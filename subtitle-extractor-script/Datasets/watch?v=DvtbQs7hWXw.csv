00:00:13|00:00:17|mentioned in passing in a previous video|NA
00:00:15|00:00:20|that I could get a good laminar flow|NA
00:00:17|00:00:21|from my kitchen taps which is nice but I|NA
00:00:20|00:00:22|also noticed something really strange|NA
00:00:21|00:00:24|recently|NA
00:00:22|00:00:27|not just from this particular kitchen|NA
00:00:24|00:00:29|tap but from any laminar flow really|NA
00:00:27|00:00:31|coming from a faucet what's this look|NA
00:00:29|00:00:34|what happens when I put my finger into|NA
00:00:31|00:00:40|the stream of water I got these ripples|NA
00:00:34|00:00:47|above my finger look as I move my finger|NA
00:00:40|00:00:50|down the ripples get tighter get broader|NA
00:00:47|00:00:51|strange my kitchen isn't the best|NA
00:00:50|00:00:53|environment to investigate this sort of|NA
00:00:51|00:00:55|phenomena so I set something up in my|NA
00:00:53|00:00:56|studio I really wanted to see if we can|NA
00:00:55|00:00:58|figure out where these ripples come from|NA
00:00:56|00:01:01|but I also wanted to capture a really|NA
00:00:58|00:01:02|good example of it the first thing you|NA
00:01:01|00:01:05|need is you need that flow of water to|NA
00:01:02|00:01:08|be really stable really consistent I|NA
00:01:05|00:01:10|managed to achieve that with this funnel|NA
00:01:08|00:01:12|and just some cloth over the bottom of|NA
00:01:10|00:01:13|it you get this beautiful laminar flow|NA
00:01:12|00:01:14|from this setup|NA
00:01:13|00:01:20|a lot of other considerations as well|NA
00:01:14|00:01:22|but let's just see what we got it's not|NA
00:01:20|00:01:25|amazing as soon as the obstruction goes|NA
00:01:22|00:01:27|in those standing waves just suddenly|NA
00:01:25|00:01:30|appear it seems like further downstream|NA
00:01:27|00:01:33|the the ripples are tighter and then as|NA
00:01:30|00:01:36|you move up the stream they get wider|NA
00:01:33|00:01:39|look at this so cool is that a standing|NA
00:01:36|00:01:41|wave what is it I also noticed that|NA
00:01:39|00:01:42|there are sweet spots like if the|NA
00:01:41|00:01:46|obstruction isn't in quite the right|NA
00:01:42|00:01:49|place you get these vibrations but one|NA
00:01:46|00:01:50|of these reports come from well for one|NA
00:01:49|00:01:52|thing you definitely need laminar flow|NA
00:01:50|00:01:53|I've mentioned that a couple of times|NA
00:01:52|00:01:55|I've not really said what it is but|NA
00:01:53|00:01:58|imagine this imagine you've got a column|NA
00:01:55|00:02:00|of water like we have and it's all|NA
00:01:58|00:02:02|streaming downwards but the water is|NA
00:02:00|00:02:04|traveling at different speeds so maybe|NA
00:02:02|00:02:06|on the inside the water is traveling|NA
00:02:04|00:02:09|more quickly than on the outside and|NA
00:02:06|00:02:11|with laminar flow you don't have any|NA
00:02:09|00:02:14|interaction between those layers of|NA
00:02:11|00:02:18|different speed they just kind of slide|NA
00:02:14|00:02:19|past each other if water was transferred|NA
00:02:18|00:02:20|between those layers|NA
00:02:19|00:02:22|of different speeds then you'd end up|NA
00:02:20|00:02:24|with turbulent flow which is like the|NA
00:02:22|00:02:27|opposite of laminar flow you can see it|NA
00:02:24|00:02:31|really well with the smoke from a candle|NA
00:02:27|00:02:32|so to begin with the smoke rises through|NA
00:02:31|00:02:34|the still air around it but doesn't|NA
00:02:32|00:02:37|interact with it at all but eventually|NA
00:02:34|00:02:40|it catches if you like on the air around|NA
00:02:37|00:02:43|it and creates these turbulent spinning|NA
00:02:40|00:02:44|twisting motions I've done a bit of|NA
00:02:43|00:02:46|research and there doesn't seem to be|NA
00:02:44|00:02:49|much literature around these ripples|NA
00:02:46|00:02:49|above an obstruction but I have found a|NA
00:02:49|00:02:52|clue|NA
00:02:49|00:02:54|and that cure is the Rayleigh plateau|NA
00:02:52|00:02:56|instability which is a fancy name for|NA
00:02:54|00:02:59|something you've probably seen many|NA
00:02:56|00:03:02|times before if you turn your tap down|NA
00:02:59|00:03:04|until it's just a fine stream eventually|NA
00:03:02|00:03:06|you'll see it breaking into droplets and|NA
00:03:04|00:03:09|that moment that it breaks into droplets|NA
00:03:06|00:03:10|that's Rayleigh plateau instability but|NA
00:03:09|00:03:12|the cool thing is if you take a|NA
00:03:10|00:03:13|freeze-frame of that happening it looks|NA
00:03:12|00:03:15|like this|NA
00:03:13|00:03:17|look at those ripples very similar to|NA
00:03:15|00:03:19|what we're getting here interesting|NA
00:03:17|00:03:21|application of the Rayleigh plateau|NA
00:03:19|00:03:23|instability is if you've got a jet of|NA
00:03:21|00:03:25|fluid hitting a surface and you want to|NA
00:03:23|00:03:28|reduce splash back simply reduce the|NA
00:03:25|00:03:32|distance to the surface until you remove|NA
00:03:28|00:03:33|all instability but why is it that you|NA
00:03:32|00:03:35|can only see those ripples in|NA
00:03:33|00:03:37|freeze-frame you can't see them with the|NA
00:03:35|00:03:38|naked eye it's because they're moving|NA
00:03:37|00:03:41|around they're moving up and down the|NA
00:03:38|00:03:44|stream as time goes on it's too fast for|NA
00:03:41|00:03:47|you to see so maybe when you're struck|NA
00:03:44|00:03:49|the flow of the stream you're generating|NA
00:03:47|00:03:51|the ripples at that point but you're|NA
00:03:49|00:03:54|fixing them in space somehow I've got a|NA
00:03:51|00:03:56|theory for how that might happen but|NA
00:03:54|00:03:58|where are the ripples come from in the|NA
00:03:56|00:04:00|first place in the Riley plateau|NA
00:03:58|00:04:03|instability well there is literature on|NA
00:04:00|00:04:04|that and it's all to do with surface|NA
00:04:03|00:04:07|tension you can think of the surface|NA
00:04:04|00:04:09|tension of water as like an elastic|NA
00:04:07|00:04:13|property that the water has on its|NA
00:04:09|00:04:14|surface so how's it gonna behave wait|NA
00:04:13|00:04:16|think about an elastic band mean you|NA
00:04:14|00:04:18|stretched an elastic band it pulls|NA
00:04:16|00:04:21|itself in an elastic band tries to|NA
00:04:18|00:04:23|minimize its length and it's similar|NA
00:04:21|00:04:27|with elastic surfaces they try to|NA
00:04:23|00:04:30|minimize their area and this is also|NA
00:04:27|00:04:30|true of soap film so when you blow a|NA
00:04:30|00:04:33|bubble|NA
00:04:30|00:04:36|it encapsulates a|NA
00:04:33|00:04:38|volume of air and it slowly kind of|NA
00:04:36|00:04:40|wobbles into its preferred shape which|NA
00:04:38|00:04:43|of course is a sphere because a sphere|NA
00:04:40|00:04:46|is the lowest surface area that can|NA
00:04:43|00:04:50|enclose a given volume and it's also why|NA
00:04:46|00:04:53|droplets of water forms spheres but what|NA
00:04:50|00:04:54|does this mean for a column of water|NA
00:04:53|00:04:57|like we have here well we can actually|NA
00:04:54|00:05:00|model it with soap film how does a|NA
00:04:57|00:05:03|cylindrical soap film minimize its|NA
00:05:00|00:05:05|surface area look as the sender grows in|NA
00:05:03|00:05:08|height the soap film starts to bow|NA
00:05:05|00:05:10|inwards this is always the minimum|NA
00:05:08|00:05:11|surface area if it was more pinched to|NA
00:05:10|00:05:13|the surface air would be greater if it|NA
00:05:11|00:05:16|was less pinched the surface air would|NA
00:05:13|00:05:19|be greater as well and as the cylinder|NA
00:05:16|00:05:22|grows in height that bowing inwards|NA
00:05:19|00:05:24|grows more pronounced anyway it gets to|NA
00:05:22|00:05:28|the point where it pinches all the way|NA
00:05:24|00:05:30|in and it separates into two separate|NA
00:05:28|00:05:32|soap films a bit like the formation of a|NA
00:05:30|00:05:35|droplet of water how does that apply to|NA
00:05:32|00:05:37|a column of water like why do the|NA
00:05:35|00:05:39|ripples appear in the particular|NA
00:05:37|00:05:43|location that they appear and why are|NA
00:05:39|00:05:46|they the size that they are well the|NA
00:05:43|00:05:49|ripples grow from tiny perturbations in|NA
00:05:46|00:05:52|the otherwise very smooth flow of water|NA
00:05:49|00:05:55|and they grow like this imagine that|NA
00:05:52|00:05:58|you've got some ripples that are kind of|NA
00:05:55|00:06:00|sinusoidal so you've got some pinch|NA
00:05:58|00:06:03|points and you've got some bulge points|NA
00:06:00|00:06:06|like this and here's an interesting fact|NA
00:06:03|00:06:10|about elastic surfaces if an elastic|NA
00:06:06|00:06:14|surface is tightly curved then the|NA
00:06:10|00:06:17|pressure inside will be great whereas if|NA
00:06:14|00:06:20|the elastic surface is loosely curved|NA
00:06:17|00:06:24|the pressure inside will be less and you|NA
00:06:20|00:06:26|can apply that to these bulges here so|NA
00:06:24|00:06:29|look at the neck here you've got a tight|NA
00:06:26|00:06:31|lid curved elastic surface so the|NA
00:06:29|00:06:33|pressure inside is very great at the|NA
00:06:31|00:06:35|Bulge you've got a loosely curved|NA
00:06:33|00:06:37|surface so the pressure is less that|NA
00:06:35|00:06:39|means that the neck will squeeze water|NA
00:06:37|00:06:42|into the Bulge and you will have this|NA
00:06:39|00:06:43|growing ripple except it's a little bit|NA
00:06:42|00:06:47|more complicated|NA
00:06:43|00:06:50|that because the curvature at the pinch|NA
00:06:47|00:06:52|points it's actually a saddle point and|NA
00:06:50|00:06:55|saddle points are a bit more complicated|NA
00:06:52|00:06:56|a good example of saddle point is a|NA
00:06:55|00:06:57|Pringle crisp so you've got a curve|NA
00:06:56|00:06:59|going this way|NA
00:06:57|00:07:01|and you've got a curve going that way|NA
00:06:59|00:07:03|like it like a saddle essentially but|NA
00:07:01|00:07:06|look imagine that this is a little|NA
00:07:03|00:07:09|section of our pinch point you've got|NA
00:07:06|00:07:10|the inside curve here that's generating|NA
00:07:09|00:07:12|pressure inside but then you've got this|NA
00:07:10|00:07:15|this is actually a negative curve it's|NA
00:07:12|00:07:18|going the other way so it's reducing the|NA
00:07:15|00:07:20|pressure inside the neck so it's|NA
00:07:18|00:07:23|actually not clear who's gonna win the|NA
00:07:20|00:07:25|fight is it the the Bulge that has like|NA
00:07:23|00:07:26|both curves of the curve in this|NA
00:07:25|00:07:27|direction the curve in this direction|NA
00:07:26|00:07:30|they're both adding to the pressure|NA
00:07:27|00:07:31|inside but look at this curve here this|NA
00:07:30|00:07:34|curve is going the other way it's a|NA
00:07:31|00:07:36|negative curvature and it actually|NA
00:07:34|00:07:39|reduces the pressure inside so there's a|NA
00:07:36|00:07:41|balance between those two effects and it|NA
00:07:39|00:07:45|turns out that who wins the fight|NA
00:07:41|00:07:48|depends on the wavelength of the ripples|NA
00:07:45|00:07:50|so with those short wavelength ripples|NA
00:07:48|00:07:52|that the Bulge is gonna win the fight|NA
00:07:50|00:07:56|and they're just going to disappear but|NA
00:07:52|00:07:59|with longer curvature ripples where the|NA
00:07:56|00:08:03|external curvature is lower then the the|NA
00:07:59|00:08:04|pressure inside the neck is going to win|NA
00:08:03|00:08:05|and the pinch point is going to get|NA
00:08:04|00:08:08|greater and greater|NA
00:08:05|00:08:10|it's those bulges that are going to grow|NA
00:08:08|00:08:15|it's that optimum wavelength that you're|NA
00:08:10|00:08:17|ultimately going to see so there's got|NA
00:08:15|00:08:19|to be a link between this Rayleigh|NA
00:08:17|00:08:21|plateau instability and the ripples that|NA
00:08:19|00:08:23|we're seeing when we all struct the|NA
00:08:21|00:08:25|stream of water my thinking is this when|NA
00:08:23|00:08:28|you put your finger into the stream|NA
00:08:25|00:08:31|you're forcing the water to bow out at|NA
00:08:28|00:08:33|that fixed point and it's a bit like a|NA
00:08:31|00:08:36|standing wave in wave mechanics so|NA
00:08:33|00:08:38|you've got a kind of boundary condition|NA
00:08:36|00:08:40|so in wave mechanics a boundary|NA
00:08:38|00:08:42|condition is when you fix a certain|NA
00:08:40|00:08:43|point like on a guitar string one end is|NA
00:08:42|00:08:45|fixed as you've got two boundary|NA
00:08:43|00:08:48|conditions both ends are fixed and that|NA
00:08:45|00:08:51|forces a standing wave in the vibrations|NA
00:08:48|00:08:54|of the guitar string and in a similar|NA
00:08:51|00:08:55|sense here you're saying look we're|NA
00:08:54|00:08:59|forcing an ant|NA
00:08:55|00:09:02|at this point and the rest of the wave|NA
00:08:59|00:09:04|is gonna grow upwards from that point|NA
00:09:02|00:09:05|like a standing wave on a guitar string|NA
00:09:04|00:09:07|that's my theory anyway|NA
00:09:05|00:09:09|I love investigating these sorts of|NA
00:09:07|00:09:11|things just for their own sake really|NA
00:09:09|00:09:13|like I'm sure nothing useful will ever|NA
00:09:11|00:09:15|come of it but I actually think|NA
00:09:13|00:09:17|curiosity for curiosity's sake is|NA
00:09:15|00:09:18|important because some of these|NA
00:09:17|00:09:20|investigations do turn out to be|NA
00:09:18|00:09:24|important like the Raley Plateau|NA
00:09:20|00:09:26|instability is really useful for making|NA
00:09:24|00:09:28|printers work like inkjet printers and|NA
00:09:26|00:09:32|all sorts of other applications actually|NA
00:09:28|00:09:34|bizarrely even black holes like some|NA
00:09:32|00:09:37|physicists are investigating what black|NA
00:09:34|00:09:39|holes look like in the extra dimensions|NA
00:09:37|00:09:42|of string theory and they're modeling it|NA
00:09:39|00:09:44|as what they call black strings and it|NA
00:09:42|00:09:46|seems like these black strings are|NA
00:09:44|00:09:49|unstable in a similar way to streams of|NA
00:09:46|00:09:52|water and they're gonna break up into|NA
00:09:49|00:09:54|like black hole droplets like the|NA
00:09:52|00:09:55|Rayleigh plateau droplets really|NA
00:09:54|00:09:58|interesting stuff this video is|NA
00:09:55|00:10:00|sponsored by Squarespace as you know I'm|NA
00:09:58|00:10:03|working with my dad on a project to|NA
00:10:00|00:10:05|publish his articles online he writes|NA
00:10:03|00:10:07|these really interesting articles about|NA
00:10:05|00:10:08|science and the nature of knowledge and|NA
00:10:07|00:10:10|things like that I really want people to|NA
00:10:08|00:10:12|be able to read them so we're putting|NA
00:10:10|00:10:15|them online and we're using Squarespace|NA
00:10:12|00:10:16|to do it I met with my dad last week and|NA
