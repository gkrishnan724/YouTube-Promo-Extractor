00:00:00|00:00:02|<st> - It is Laminar Flow day and you know this about me,|NA
00:00:02|00:00:04|I love Laminar Flow.|NA
00:00:04|00:00:06|There's a cool video on Smarter Every Day|NA
00:00:06|00:00:07|that talks about how Laminar Flow works|NA
00:00:07|00:00:12|but we're doing what I call today, Ultra Laminar Flow!|NA
00:00:12|00:00:13|It's not really called that, I just made this sign|NA
00:00:13|00:00:14|to try to make it a thing.|NA
00:00:14|00:00:15|But, check this out!|NA
00:00:15|00:00:18|We're gonna look at something called Taylor-Couette Flow.|NA
00:00:18|00:00:20|My man here, Maurice Couette, French guy.|NA
00:00:20|00:00:22|He came up with a device,|NA
00:00:22|00:00:24|so you could quantify the viscosity|NA
00:00:24|00:00:26|of a fluid, by a cylinder rotating|NA
00:00:26|00:00:29|on the inside of another cylinder, it's really cool work.|NA
00:00:29|00:00:33|My dude here, Sir Taylor, he expanded on Couette's work|NA
00:00:33|00:00:36|and he measured stability inside Couette Flow.|NA
00:00:36|00:00:39|So you combine the two, you get Taylor-Couette Flow.|NA
00:00:39|00:00:42|What we're gonna look at today, if it works,|NA
00:00:42|00:00:43|I really want this to work, I've been wanting to do|NA
00:00:43|00:00:45|this experiment for a long time, we're gonna look at|NA
00:00:45|00:00:50|ultra low Reynolds Number's Flow, and hopefully, hopefully,|NA
00:00:50|00:00:52|we get reversible flow.|NA
00:00:52|00:00:53|Let's do this.|NA
00:00:53|00:00:55|First things first, we've gotta fill up the tank.|NA
00:00:55|00:00:59|This is corn syrup, which is a very viscous fluid.|NA
00:00:59|00:01:01|Here we go, it's gonna take quite a while,|NA
00:01:01|00:01:02|this is a lot of corn syrup.|NA
00:01:02|00:01:04|Liquid rope coiling effect.|NA
00:01:04|00:01:06|We should revisit that.|NA
00:01:06|00:01:07|That's a topic for another video.|NA
00:01:07|00:01:09|Okay, here's the magic of Taylor-Couette Flow.|NA
00:01:09|00:01:12|You have something called a no slip boundary condition.|NA
00:01:12|00:01:14|So on this inner cylinder here,|NA
00:01:14|00:01:16|the corn syrup wants to stick to it,|NA
00:01:16|00:01:18|and on the outer cylinder, it also wants to stick there.|NA
00:01:18|00:01:21|So, if I'm rotating that inner cylinder,|NA
00:01:21|00:01:24|what's happening is it will try to move along with it.|NA
00:01:24|00:01:28|So if we were to draw a line across the gap there|NA
00:01:28|00:01:29|and we were to rotate it,|NA
00:01:29|00:01:31|the inner cylinder would pull (bright guitar music)|NA
00:01:31|00:01:33|along the inner corn syrup,|NA
00:01:33|00:01:34|and the outer corn syrup would stay there.|NA
00:01:34|00:01:37|And so what would happen is, you would create|NA
00:01:37|00:01:38|this spiral pattern.|NA
00:01:38|00:01:39|In fact, if you look down through there,|NA
00:01:39|00:01:42|you can kinda see it happening in the clear fluid.|NA
00:01:42|00:01:44|So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna put|NA
00:01:44|00:01:46|this colored corn syrup in there,|NA
00:01:46|00:01:49|and because we have so such a low Reynolds Number here,|NA
00:01:49|00:01:53|that's Laminar Flow, and it should, should, be reversible.|NA
00:01:53|00:01:55|Okay, so as I put this color in here,|NA
00:01:55|00:01:56|I wanna recommend something.|NA
00:01:56|00:02:00|What you're about to see is absolutely incredible|NA
00:02:00|00:02:03|and you're only gonna get to unwrap this present once.|NA
00:02:03|00:02:05|So if you would, please trust me|NA
00:02:05|00:02:07|and don't fast forward this video.|NA
00:02:07|00:02:10|In order to fully appreciate what you're about to see,|NA
00:02:10|00:02:14|you need to watch it unfold in real time.|NA
00:02:14|00:02:15|Okay, here we go.|NA
00:02:15|00:02:17|We're gonna go for seven rotations,|NA
00:02:17|00:02:19|everything I've seen on the internet does five.|NA
00:02:19|00:02:20|And, go.|NA
00:02:27|00:02:31|So you should see the spiral start to happen.|NA
00:02:31|00:02:34|(bright guitar music)|NA
00:02:38|00:02:39|One.|NA
00:02:55|00:02:56|Two.|NA
00:03:00|00:03:02|I see the spirals.|NA
00:03:12|00:03:13|Three.|NA
00:03:17|00:03:18|Is your heart pounding?|NA
00:03:20|00:03:21|- [Trent] That is amazing.|NA
00:03:21|00:03:22|- Can you see the spirals in there?|NA
00:03:22|00:03:23|- [Trent] Yeah.|NA
00:03:28|00:03:31|Four, it's like making candy cane lookin' things.|NA
00:03:34|00:03:36|I don't think it's linear.|NA
00:03:36|00:03:39|Like, I think the gradient of the flow|NA
00:03:39|00:03:42|across the entire thing.|NA
00:03:42|00:03:44|- [Trent] Dude, that is beautiful man.|NA
00:03:44|00:03:45|- Is this six?|NA
00:03:46|00:03:47|- I think it's seven. - I think it's six,|NA
00:03:47|00:03:49|I don't know. (laughs)|NA
00:03:49|00:03:50|Got so excited!|NA
00:03:52|00:03:52|Oh dude.|NA
00:03:56|00:03:58|Look at that.|NA
00:03:58|00:04:00|It's like a marble.|NA
00:04:00|00:04:00|Can you see it?|NA
00:04:06|00:04:09|Focus further down in there, seven!|NA
00:04:09|00:04:10|Okay, here we go.|NA
00:04:13|00:04:18|Seven, it looks like it's completely just all mixed up.|NA
00:04:20|00:04:22|Oh man, it looks like you could never|NA
00:04:22|00:04:22|get that back together.|NA
00:04:22|00:04:23|Okay, here we go.|NA
00:04:23|00:04:24|This should work.|NA
00:04:24|00:04:26|Reversible Flow.|NA
00:04:26|00:04:28|Ultra Laminar Flow, Taylor-Couette.|NA
00:04:29|00:04:30|We'll see what you got boys.|NA
00:04:30|00:04:31|You ready?|NA
00:04:32|00:04:35|Here we go. (upbeat music)|NA
00:04:35|00:04:36|I'm nervous it's not gonna work.|NA
00:04:36|00:04:37|Oh golly.|NA
00:04:42|00:04:45|(video fast forwarding tone)|NA
00:04:50|00:04:53|We should have four spirals after this.|NA
00:04:53|00:04:55|(video fast forwarding tone)|NA
00:04:55|00:04:58|I have lost count because (laughs) I'm so excited.|NA
00:04:59|00:05:02|I think it's coming up on five.|NA
00:05:02|00:05:03|That's five.|NA
00:05:03|00:05:06|Get in there tight, it's about to start getting crazy.|NA
00:05:07|00:05:08|We got two more.|NA
00:05:09|00:05:12|Come on baby, I'm so worried that the red and the blue|NA
00:05:12|00:05:14|are gonna mix because they were very,|NA
00:05:14|00:05:18|very close to each other, like radially.|NA
00:05:18|00:05:20|Six, okay.|NA
00:05:21|00:05:21|This should be it.|NA
00:05:22|00:05:24|Please work.|NA
00:05:25|00:05:27|I want you to work so bad.|NA
00:05:30|00:05:31|Is it working?|NA
00:05:34|00:05:36|Did it work?|NA
00:05:36|00:05:37|- [Trent] I think so.|NA
00:05:39|00:05:39|- Yes!|NA
00:05:39|00:05:41|(laughs)|NA
00:05:42|00:05:44|That's awesome.|NA
00:05:44|00:05:46|So it worked.|NA
00:05:46|00:05:48|Oh, you can see shear thinning in there.|NA
00:05:48|00:05:50|Okay, look, the, can I see that?|NA
00:05:50|00:05:55|So the, the different levels of, look at that.|NA
00:05:55|00:05:57|So if you get way down in there, look.|NA
00:05:57|00:05:59|You see all those striations, that happens|NA
00:05:59|00:06:01|because of the way we were mixing it.|NA
00:06:01|00:06:05|It looks like different layers sheared at different rates.|NA
00:06:05|00:06:09|So we had different viscosities at different times|NA
00:06:09|00:06:11|and so we get this striated pattern.|NA
00:06:11|00:06:12|But we did it!|NA
00:06:12|00:06:13|My boys!|NA
00:06:13|00:06:15|My boys, what ya got?|NA
00:06:15|00:06:17|Taylor and Couette.|NA
00:06:17|00:06:18|Hi-five, yeah, yeah!|NA
00:06:18|00:06:19|What do you do when you do the thing|NA
00:06:19|00:06:20|you've always wanted to do?|NA
00:06:20|00:06:21|I don't know what to do.|NA
00:06:21|00:06:23|Do we go the other way?|NA
00:06:23|00:06:24|Let's do it. (bright guitar music)|NA
00:06:24|00:06:28|Okay, so this is an awesome fluid mechanics demonstration.|NA
00:06:28|00:06:31|But for me, there's a metaphor to all this.|NA
00:06:31|00:06:34|Sometimes it feels like life is turbulent,|NA
00:06:34|00:06:36|like everything is jumbled up and there's no way|NA
00:06:36|00:06:38|you're ever gonna get things set straight.|NA
00:06:38|00:06:42|But I believe, if you slowly and methodically|NA
00:06:42|00:06:46|think about the way you got yourself into the situation|NA
00:06:46|00:06:49|and start thinking about how to get out of that situation,|NA
00:06:49|00:06:53|and take slow, deliberate steps, hopefully, hopefully,|NA
00:06:53|00:06:54|I know it's not possible for everyone,|NA
00:06:54|00:06:57|something that looks like, is a complete mess|NA
00:06:57|00:07:00|and it'll never be set straight, hopefully, one day,|NA
00:07:00|00:07:03|you will actually be able to get out of the situation.|NA
00:07:03|00:07:07|But, it requires patience and deliberate thinking|NA
00:07:07|00:07:09|to get it all straightened out.|NA
00:07:09|00:07:11|Anyway, I wanted to tell you about a book|NA
00:07:11|00:07:14|that makes me think about this principal for life.|NA
00:07:14|00:07:15|I'll do that now. (beep)|NA
00:07:15|00:07:16|Okay, this episode of Smarter Every Day,|A
00:07:16|00:07:18|was sponsored by Audible.|A
00:07:18|00:07:21|As you know, Audible is a great way to listen to audio books|A
00:07:21|00:07:24|and I spend the bulk of my time on the go|A
00:07:24|00:07:26|and it is a way for me to reclaim that time|A
00:07:26|00:07:27|in order to learn.|A
00:07:27|00:07:29|So you can get an audio book|A
00:07:29|00:07:31|by going to audible.com/smarter,|A
00:07:31|00:07:34|or texting the word, Smarter, to 500-500.|A
00:07:34|00:07:35|The book I wanna talk to you today about|A
00:07:35|00:07:38|is called the Sun Does Shine, by Anthony Ray Hinton,|A
00:07:38|00:07:39|who was wrongly convicted of murder|A
00:07:39|00:07:41|and served on death row for decades.|A
00:07:41|00:07:44|Anthony Ray Hinton is an amazing writer|A
00:07:44|00:07:45|and it's told from his perspective|A
00:07:45|00:07:47|from many years living on death row.|A
00:07:47|00:07:50|This has changed the way I look at the world|A
00:07:50|00:07:52|and I want you to listen to this book.|A
00:07:52|00:07:53|I gotta go to the airport.|A
00:07:53|00:07:56|(thudding)|A
00:07:59|00:08:00|All right, let's go.|A
00:08:00|00:08:01|My wife books my seats.|A
00:08:01|00:08:03|Thank you very much wife.|A
00:08:03|00:08:06|(engine roaring)|A
00:08:10|00:08:11|- [Anthony Ray Hinton] If I could put my heart|A
00:08:11|00:08:15|in the judges heart, he would know I didn't do it.|A
00:08:15|00:08:16|- So one thing I really like about the app|A
00:08:16|00:08:18|is you can click this little Clip button right here|A
00:08:18|00:08:20|and you can add a note in the book|A
00:08:20|00:08:22|and you can go back and listen to it later|A
00:08:22|00:08:24|and you can bring back all those thoughts and memories|A
00:08:24|00:08:27|and think more deeply about the subject at hand.|A
00:08:27|00:08:28|It's a really cool feature.|A
00:08:28|00:08:30|(engine humming)|A
00:08:32|00:08:35|You can get a free audio book and two Audible originals|A
00:08:35|00:08:37|by going to audible.com/smarter|A
00:08:37|00:08:41|or texting the word, Smarter, to 500-500.|A
00:08:41|00:08:43|You're gonna enjoy audio books.|A
00:08:43|00:08:44|I get smarter when I travel.|A
00:08:44|00:08:47|This is time that feels that I'm kinda wasting it,|A
00:08:47|00:08:49|but when you're listening to audio books, you get smarter.|A
00:08:49|00:08:51|So, again, text Smarter to 500-500|A
00:08:51|00:08:54|or go to audible.com/smarter. (beep)|A
00:08:54|00:08:57|If you wanna see just the tripod shot,|NA
00:08:57|00:08:59|and that being sped up, go check out that video|NA
00:08:59|00:09:01|I'm putting over on the second channel.|NA
00:09:01|00:09:02|I think you'll like that.|NA
00:09:02|00:09:05|Thank you if you decided to actually watch this video|NA
00:09:05|00:09:07|and learn about these principals with me,|NA
00:09:07|00:09:08|instead of just watching a GIF on the internet|NA
00:09:08|00:09:11|and not, like, diving into the science of what's going on.|NA
00:09:11|00:09:12|So thank you.|NA
00:09:12|00:09:14|If you're interested in subscribing to Smarter Every Day,|NA
00:09:14|00:09:16|like if you feel like this kinda content earns it,|NA
00:09:16|00:09:17|then thanks, that'd be awesome.|NA
00:09:17|00:09:19|Feel free to ring the bell, if that's what you're into.|NA
00:09:19|00:09:21|If you're not into that, no big deal,|NA
00:09:21|00:09:22|but I'm just happy that you're here.|NA
00:09:22|00:09:24|Thanks for doing this with me.|NA
00:09:24|00:09:25|Let's do it one more time, and,|NA
00:09:27|00:09:30|boom, (laughs) that's awesome.|NA
00:09:31|00:09:32|Dude, that works well! </st>|NA
00:00:00|00:00:03|<st> a couple of months ago I made a Twitter|NA
00:00:01|00:00:05|thread about some weird activity I saw|NA
00:00:03|00:00:07|online and after I posted that thread|NA
00:00:05|00:00:08|tons of engineers from many different|NA
00:00:07|00:00:10|tech companies reached out to me|NA
00:00:08|00:00:12|privately to tell me their stories my|NA
00:00:10|00:00:14|interest in all this started one day|NA
00:00:12|00:00:15|when I was scrolling on YouTube and the|NA
00:00:14|00:00:17|algorithm served up a pretty weird video|NA
00:00:15|00:00:19|for me to watch you know how the|NA
00:00:17|00:00:20|algorithm works right it looks at your|NA
00:00:19|00:00:22|past activity and tries to figure out|NA
00:00:20|00:00:24|what you could watch in the future that|NA
00:00:22|00:00:26|would keep you on the platform the|NA
00:00:24|00:00:28|longest it optimizes watch time the|NA
00:00:26|00:00:30|algorithm suggested I watched this video|NA
00:00:28|00:00:32|now I'm not a super political guy but I|NA
00:00:30|00:00:34|know those are important topics and it|NA
00:00:32|00:00:36|had 138 thousand views and it was only|NA
00:00:34|00:00:38|one day old so to me this looked like it|NA
00:00:36|00:00:41|was a real news story so when I clicked|NA
00:00:38|00:00:43|on the video it got weird fast strange|NA
00:00:41|00:00:46|music starts playing and a robot voice|NA
00:00:43|00:00:49|comes on and clearly starts reading me a|NA
00:00:46|00:00:52|script after Trump sins no to Ginsburg|NA
00:00:49|00:00:55|he breaks silence on plan for Supreme|NA
00:00:52|00:00:58|Court Democrats didn't think Donald|NA
00:00:55|00:01:00|would dare get ready America Ruth Bader|NA
00:00:58|00:01:03|Ginsburg hasn't been seen in public in|NA
00:01:00|00:01:05|457 days there were red flags all over|NA

00:01:05|00:01:09|typos the name of the channel itself was|NA
00:01:07|00:01:11|some generic faking news site there's no|NA
00:01:09|00:01:14|way this is legitimate news but the|NA
00:01:11|00:01:17|problem is it had engagement levels that|NA
00:01:14|00:01:19|were off the chart 94% liked to dislike|NA
00:01:17|00:01:21|ratio look at all these comments how can|NA
00:01:19|00:01:23|this be happening on a video of such low|NA
00:01:21|00:01:25|quality I started digging a little bit|NA
00:01:23|00:01:28|deeper so I searched YouTube for the|NA
00:01:25|00:01:31|exact same title to see what came up and|NA
00:01:28|00:01:34|whoa look at this all these videos are|NA
00:01:31|00:01:36|exactly the same title exactly the same|NA
00:01:34|00:01:39|script but they're all just a little bit|NA
00:01:36|00:01:41|different if you play the videos you get|NA
00:01:39|00:01:43|different graphics scrolling across the|NA
00:01:41|00:01:45|scene you might get a different robot|NA

00:02:09|00:02:14|the content was essentially the same it|NA
00:02:12|00:02:16|was just arranged in a different way|NA
00:02:14|00:02:18|different photos different b-roll|NA
00:02:16|00:02:20|different title screens I'm a youtuber|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|and I spend some time thinking about|NA
00:02:20|00:02:24|content ID systems and things like that|NA
00:02:22|00:02:26|and it's clear to me that these|NA
00:02:24|00:02:28|manipulations of the video and even the|NA
00:02:26|00:02:31|audio are attempts to get around|NA
00:02:28|00:02:33|YouTube's automated recognition systems|NA
00:02:31|00:02:34|let me explain how this works YouTube's|NA
00:02:33|00:02:37|engineers look at the individual pixels|NA
00:02:34|00:02:38|on a video and then they use the values|NA
00:02:37|00:02:40|of these pixels to perform some type of|NA
00:02:38|00:02:43|mathematical function which gives you a|NA
00:02:40|00:02:44|number called a hash you then compare|NA
00:02:43|00:02:46|hashes to other videos that have been|NA
00:02:44|00:02:48|uploaded and try to figure out if the|NA
00:02:46|00:02:50|same content has been uploaded by|NA
00:02:48|00:02:52|someone else in the past the challenging|NA
00:02:50|00:02:54|task here is to make a system that's|NA
00:02:52|00:02:56|fast enough to find exact copies of|NA
00:02:54|00:02:58|specific frames of video across the|NA
00:02:56|00:03:00|entire YouTube library while at the same|NA
00:02:58|00:03:01|time making it smart enough to not be|NA
00:03:00|00:03:04|tricked how would you do that with math|NA
00:03:01|00:03:05|instead of sampling every pixel what|NA
00:03:04|00:03:07|have they sampled specific spots on|NA
00:03:05|00:03:10|every video and measured the color|NA
00:03:07|00:03:11|values at those specific locations they|NA
00:03:10|00:03:13|could then compare those spots with|NA
00:03:11|00:03:15|every other video uploaded to YouTube|NA
00:03:13|00:03:18|but think about what happens if a sneaky|NA
00:03:15|00:03:20|person resizes those images the colors|NA
00:03:18|00:03:22|would change at those locations the same|NA
00:03:20|00:03:24|thing would happen if you rotate the|NA
00:03:22|00:03:26|image or flip it or even apply a filter|NA
00:03:24|00:03:28|of some kind now I don't know how|NA
00:03:26|00:03:30|YouTube samples these pixels or the|NA
00:03:28|00:03:31|audio from the video or what|NA
00:03:30|00:03:33|mathematical functions they use but I|NA
00:03:31|00:03:35|know that's like a company secret|NA
00:03:33|00:03:37|because that's how they defend the|NA
00:03:35|00:03:40|platform if the bad guys were to figure|NA
00:03:37|00:03:42|out how these detection algorithms work|NA
00:03:40|00:03:44|then they could get around them and they|NA
00:03:42|00:03:45|could beat the defense's if you look at|NA
00:03:44|00:03:47|these crazy videos like a software|NA
00:03:45|00:03:49|engineer you can start to see some|NA
00:03:47|00:03:51|really interesting details for example|NA
00:03:49|00:03:53|why would there be a globe spinning in|NA
00:03:51|00:03:55|this image well if you think about it|NA
00:03:53|00:03:57|that's going to change the hash what if|NA
00:03:55|00:03:58|the YouTube engineers figured the globe|NA
00:03:57|00:04:01|trick out and then they shut that|NA
00:03:58|00:04:03|technique down well in this video the|NA
00:04:01|00:04:05|globe is mirrored that's going to change|NA
00:04:03|00:04:08|the hash in a different way this|NA
00:04:05|00:04:11|specific instance is a counter counter|NA
00:04:08|00:04:12|countermeasure which is fascinating this|NA
00:04:11|00:04:15|one is probably my favorite why on earth|NA
00:04:12|00:04:16|would they put virtual snow falling over|NA
00:04:15|00:04:18|the top of a video of the road|NA
00:04:16|00:04:21|family if you think about it this|NA
00:04:18|00:04:23|changes the math in a kind of random way|NA
00:04:21|00:04:25|and therefore YouTube's ability to|NA
00:04:23|00:04:27|detect it this is like a new form of|NA
00:04:25|00:04:30|camouflage that's using math instead of|NA
00:04:27|00:04:32|colors on this new bot battlefield where|NA
00:04:30|00:04:34|daily fights take place by opposing|NA
00:04:32|00:04:36|forces of software engineers but instead|NA
00:04:34|00:04:37|of fighting over hills or pieces of land|NA
00:04:36|00:04:40|the winner of these individual|NA
00:04:37|00:04:42|skirmishes gets a few moments of your|NA
00:04:40|00:04:44|time which in today's attention economy|NA
00:04:42|00:04:46|is super valuable because of the|NA
00:04:44|00:04:47|original video I found I assumed most of|NA
00:04:46|00:04:49|this activity was on the right but I|NA
00:04:47|00:04:52|found these videos just two clicks away|NA
00:04:49|00:04:55|from a mainstream channel on the Left|NA
00:04:52|00:04:59|Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi just|NA
00:04:55|00:05:01|keeps racking up wins over Donald Trump|NA
00:04:59|00:05:04|Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi just|NA
00:05:01|00:05:06|keeps racking up wins over Donald Trump|NA
00:05:04|00:05:08|it's the exact same stuff just trying to|NA
00:05:06|00:05:10|manipulate things in the other direction|NA
00:05:08|00:05:11|if you look at this channel specifically|NA
00:05:10|00:05:13|it was started over 10 years ago about|NA
00:05:11|00:05:15|what appears to be an actual human it|NA
00:05:13|00:05:17|uploaded a bunch of gaming content and|NA
00:05:15|00:05:19|then at this moment right here it|NA
00:05:17|00:05:21|started uploading videos about politics|NA
00:05:19|00:05:23|at this point it's clear to me this is|NA
00:05:21|00:05:25|not just low-quality content this is a|NA
00:05:23|00:05:26|coordinated attack against the YouTube|NA
00:05:25|00:05:28|algorithm a complete with|NA
00:05:26|00:05:31|countermeasures this is a serious|NA
00:05:28|00:05:33|well-funded activity done by people|NA
00:05:31|00:05:35|meant to do harm if you're a teen or|NA
00:05:33|00:05:36|20-something you probably think these|NA
00:05:35|00:05:38|old people are getting duped into voting|NA
00:05:36|00:05:39|for someone that doesn't make sense and|NA
00:05:38|00:05:41|if you've got a few more miles on the|NA
00:05:39|00:05:42|tires you might be looking at the|NA
00:05:41|00:05:44|younger generation and thinking man how|NA
00:05:42|00:05:46|are all these manipulative people able|NA
00:05:44|00:05:48|to whip them up into a frenzy so easily|NA
00:05:46|00:05:50|so is the internet getting worse because|NA
00:05:48|00:05:51|we're getting worse and this is just a|NA
00:05:50|00:05:53|reflection of us or is there actually|NA
00:05:51|00:05:54|someone playing with the dials and|NA
00:05:53|00:05:56|pitting us against each other|NA
00:05:54|00:05:59|today's social discourse takes place on|NA
00:05:56|00:06:01|the public forum of the Internet in|NA
00:05:59|00:06:04|front and center in that forum are three|NA
00:06:01|00:06:06|primary platforms YouTube Twitter and|NA
00:06:04|00:06:09|Facebook this video is the first in a|NA
00:06:06|00:06:11|three-part series on what exactly these|NA
00:06:09|00:06:13|external forces are doing to manipulate|NA
00:06:11|00:06:15|our social media platforms and how|NA
00:06:13|00:06:17|they're doing it now the key to a good|NA
00:06:15|00:06:18|lie is to convince you that there is no|NA
00:06:17|00:06:20|deception when I started trying to|NA
00:06:18|00:06:21|research this stuff there's all kinds of|NA
00:06:20|00:06:23|information on the internet but it's|NA
00:06:21|00:06:25|very difficult to cut through all the|NA
00:06:23|00:06:27|falsehood so my approach is pretty|NA
00:06:25|00:06:29|simple I'm literally going to get on|NA
00:06:27|00:06:31|airplanes and fly to the engine|NA
00:06:29|00:06:33|we're trying to beat this stuff and have|NA
00:06:31|00:06:34|a straight-up conversation with them|NA
00:06:33|00:06:36|we're gonna get to Twitter and Facebook|NA
00:06:34|00:06:38|later but for the purposes of this video|NA
00:06:36|00:06:40|let's look at specific active attempts|NA
00:06:38|00:06:42|to manipulate the YouTube algorithm okay|NA
00:06:40|00:06:44|it's time to move past the speculation|NA
00:06:42|00:06:46|stage to the actual engineering data|NA
00:06:44|00:06:48|stage so I'm here at this building in|NA
00:06:46|00:06:50|California the person I'm gonna talk to|NA
00:06:48|00:06:51|does not want to be on camera so we're|NA
00:06:50|00:06:53|gonna respect that but I'm gonna go find|NA
00:06:51|00:06:55|out exactly what went down with these|NA
00:06:53|00:06:57|specific videos and report back I was|NA
00:06:55|00:06:59|just gonna stand in front of the Sun and|NA
00:06:57|00:07:00|tell you what happened but I have to|NA
00:06:59|00:07:03|think about how I'm gonna say this this|NA
00:07:00|00:07:04|is complicated I don't want to attribute|NA
00:07:03|00:07:06|any words to YouTube here so let's just|NA
00:07:04|00:07:08|assume these are my words but there|NA
00:07:06|00:07:10|seems to be two types of attack against|NA
00:07:08|00:07:12|the YouTube algorithm number one there|NA
00:07:10|00:07:15|seems to be a financial motivation|NA
00:07:12|00:07:17|people are trying to create videos to|NA
00:07:15|00:07:19|extract ad revenue from YouTube and so|NA
00:07:17|00:07:20|this is legitimate content there's|NA
00:07:19|00:07:23|nothing outside of the Terms of Service|NA
00:07:20|00:07:25|here except maybe the fake engagement|NA
00:07:23|00:07:27|policies that YouTube has but for the|NA
00:07:25|00:07:29|most part it's legitimate content|NA
00:07:27|00:07:32|uploaded and meant to extract money from|NA
00:07:29|00:07:34|YouTube number two are the ideological|NA
00:07:32|00:07:36|attacks these are attacks meant to sway|NA
00:07:34|00:07:37|public opinion and make people think of|NA
00:07:36|00:07:39|certain things and perhaps even make|NA
00:07:37|00:07:40|people fight with each other to|NA
00:07:39|00:07:42|understand this better I rented an|NA
00:07:40|00:07:44|office in San Francisco to interview|NA
00:07:42|00:07:46|Renee de Resta she's an expert in|NA
00:07:44|00:07:49|malicious propaganda online|NA
00:07:46|00:07:52|okay guys Renee de Resta she is super|NA
00:07:49|00:07:53|smart on I guess you'd say coordinated|NA
00:07:52|00:07:55|and authentic behavior incentivized|NA
00:07:53|00:07:58|content on social media and how to beat|NA
00:07:55|00:08:00|it right yep I look at how different|NA
00:07:58|00:08:02|types of actors manipulate the social|NA
00:08:00|00:08:03|ecosystem across platforms awesome I|NA
00:08:02|00:08:05|love your stuff on Rogan and Sam Harris|NA
00:08:03|00:08:07|podcast yeah just great if you're paying|NA
00:08:05|00:08:09|attention you've seen what she does I|NA
00:08:07|00:08:12|want to talk about what's going on on|NA
00:08:09|00:08:15|YouTube okay recently I found this|NA
00:08:12|00:08:17|really weird video it's clearly|NA
00:08:15|00:08:18|manufactured content and from what I can|NA
00:08:17|00:08:21|tell there's two reasons that there's|NA
00:08:18|00:08:23|many veteran content number one is it's|NA
00:08:21|00:08:26|financially motivated and the second|NA
00:08:23|00:08:28|thing is ideological yes right is that|NA
00:08:26|00:08:30|correct is there a third component I'm|NA
00:08:28|00:08:31|not seeing no that's correct and there's|NA
00:08:30|00:08:33|a lot of there's actually some overlap|NA
00:08:31|00:08:35|there because if you're producing really|NA
00:08:33|00:08:37|highly partisan content particularly|NA
00:08:35|00:08:39|sensational stuff you're able to capture|NA
00:08:37|00:08:41|engagement get people paying attention|NA
00:08:39|00:08:43|because particularly right now in a high|NA
00:08:41|00:08:45|partisan polarized country people are|NA
00:08:43|00:08:46|looking for that stuff and they're not|NA
00:08:45|00:08:49|necessarily paying a lot of attention to|NA
00:08:46|00:08:50|who the sources so if you make something|NA
00:08:49|00:08:53|that looks interesting you'll be able to|NA
00:08:50|00:08:55|theoretically attract views key people|NA
00:08:53|00:08:57|there and then you can both monetize and|NA
00:08:55|00:08:58|do something divisive you're going to|NA
00:08:57|00:09:00|use fake accounts to socialize it within|NA
00:08:58|00:09:02|groups and then you're going to try to|NA
00:09:00|00:09:04|get a critical mass of real people to|NA
00:09:02|00:09:05|come and amplify it in order to get|NA
00:09:04|00:09:07|these videos in front of human eyeballs|NA
00:09:05|00:09:09|you have the first trick a robot|NA
00:09:07|00:09:11|algorithm type thing and the way you do|NA
00:09:09|00:09:13|that is with artificial engagement|NA
00:09:11|00:09:15|artificial engagement is done with fake|NA
00:09:13|00:09:17|logins or compromised accounts they sell|NA
00:09:15|00:09:19|them like wine on the black market a new|NA
00:09:17|00:09:21|ones gonna set you back about a quarter|NA
00:09:19|00:09:21|a 2014 is gonna set you back about seven|NA
00:09:21|00:09:23|bucks|NA
00:09:21|00:09:25|Renee showed me some footage of what she|NA
00:09:23|00:09:26|calls a click farm they used these|NA
00:09:25|00:09:29|devices to try to artificially inflate|NA
00:09:26|00:09:31|engagement online you can easily find|NA
00:09:29|00:09:33|these places online that will sell these|NA
00:09:31|00:09:35|services to you straight up you know a|NA
00:09:33|00:09:36|lot of us we use the number of views|NA
00:09:35|00:09:38|number of likes number of followers is|NA
00:09:36|00:09:41|like a heuristic for quality and so|NA
00:09:38|00:09:42|there are hundred and hundred and|NA
00:09:41|00:09:44|hundreds of these businesses that just|NA
00:09:42|00:09:47|offer you things like views so these are|NA
00:09:44|00:09:49|people who are just selling selling|NA
00:09:47|00:09:52|likes funny enough based on the number|NA
00:09:49|00:09:53|of likes on the ad for YouTube likes I|NA
00:09:52|00:09:56|would bet that their gaming their|NA
00:09:53|00:10:03|Instagram and girls went to the Internet|NA
00:09:56|00:10:04|is faking the strategy seems to be|NA
00:10:03|00:10:06|pretty simple you make a bunch of videos|NA
00:10:04|00:10:08|on one particular topic you put them|NA
00:10:06|00:10:09|online and then the metadata points to|NA
00:10:08|00:10:11|each other right|NA
00:10:09|00:10:13|at this point the artificial compromised|NA
00:10:11|00:10:15|accounts are used to give them|NA
00:10:13|00:10:17|artificial lift and at some point one of|NA
00:10:15|00:10:18|these videos will creep up above the|NA
00:10:17|00:10:21|noise and the algorithm and it will|NA
00:10:18|00:10:22|start to get shown to actual humans it's|NA
00:10:21|00:10:24|really easy to get mad at YouTube at|NA
00:10:22|00:10:25|this point right look at all this stuff|NA
00:10:24|00:10:27|that's happening on the platform but|NA
00:10:25|00:10:29|listen let's step back think about it if|NA
00:10:27|00:10:32|you were a software engineer how would|NA
00:10:29|00:10:34|you use math and algorithms to detect|NA
00:10:32|00:10:37|this activity I would argue that this is|NA
00:10:34|00:10:38|very very clever and it's very hard to|NA
00:10:37|00:10:40|detect this in an automated way if you|NA
00:10:38|00:10:42|look at the engagement on these videos|NA
00:10:40|00:10:44|the majority of these comments are|NA
00:10:42|00:10:47|actual humans discussing the videos|NA
00:10:44|00:10:49|these are real people engaging with this|NA
00:10:47|00:10:52|content from an engineering perspective|NA
00:10:49|00:10:53|this is extremely difficult to detect|NA
00:10:52|00:10:55|especially at any kind of meaningful|NA
00:10:53|00:10:56|scale so|NA
00:10:55|00:10:57|understand the fake engagement piece|NA
00:10:56|00:11:00|right but think about the content|NA
00:10:57|00:11:02|creation itself for a video that I'm|NA
00:11:00|00:11:03|proud of for example it will take dozens|NA
00:11:02|00:11:05|of hours for me to make this thing right|NA
00:11:03|00:11:06|in this one particular case we're|NA
00:11:05|00:11:08|talking about we saw dozens of videos|NA
00:11:06|00:11:11|uploaded in the same day so clearly|NA
00:11:08|00:11:12|computers are involved but how are they|NA
00:11:11|00:11:14|doing it believe it or not there's|NA
00:11:12|00:11:16|already an entire industry built around|NA
00:11:14|00:11:18|this technology it's a great way to get|NA
00:11:16|00:11:20|these small stories out whatever website|NA
00:11:18|00:11:21|you go to to get your news you've|NA
00:11:20|00:11:23|probably seen these things automatically|NA
00:11:21|00:11:25|generated videos several companies offer|NA
00:11:23|00:11:27|these types of services one is called|NA
00:11:25|00:11:29|watch it if you go to the watch it|NA
00:11:27|00:11:31|website they boast over 1.5 million|NA
00:11:29|00:11:33|videos were created on behalf of their|NA
00:11:31|00:11:35|customers last month these are videos|NA
00:11:33|00:11:37|created for businesses you recognize on|NA
00:11:35|00:11:39|their website they show how the system|NA
00:11:37|00:11:41|works you type in the topic you want to|NA
00:11:39|00:11:42|make a video about they ingest millions|NA
00:11:41|00:11:44|of pieces of licensed content from|NA
00:11:42|00:11:46|different sources you slap in a script|NA
00:11:44|00:11:48|and you have a video within minutes this|NA
00:11:46|00:11:50|is a very expensive business-to-business|NA
00:11:48|00:11:52|service but for these businesses trying|NA
00:11:50|00:11:54|to make it in the attention economy it's|NA
00:11:52|00:11:57|totally worth it now let's think about|NA
00:11:54|00:12:00|YouTube the watchit news YouTube channel|NA
00:11:57|00:12:01|has uploaded over 3,000 videos in the|NA
00:12:00|00:12:03|last two months|NA
00:12:01|00:12:05|most of these use actual voice actors|NA
00:12:03|00:12:08|reading a script this is an incredible|NA
00:12:05|00:12:09|amount of content stop and think about|NA
00:12:08|00:12:11|what that could mean for the future of|NA
00:12:09|00:12:14|YouTube it works like this you have all|NA
00:12:11|00:12:15|this content like b-roll photos audio|NA
00:12:14|00:12:18|things of that nature and it goes into|NA
00:12:15|00:12:20|this machine and out pops these videos|NA
00:12:18|00:12:21|which is cool if you're a newsroom and|NA
00:12:20|00:12:24|you're using a service like watch it to|NA
00:12:21|00:12:26|try to create content for legit users|NA
00:12:24|00:12:28|online but the problem is this is just|NA
00:12:26|00:12:30|technology think about what would happen|NA
00:12:28|00:12:32|if this was developed by people of ill|NA
00:12:30|00:12:34|intent if you're clever you can change|NA
00:12:32|00:12:35|the content that you're putting into the|NA
00:12:34|00:12:37|machine and the machine can start|NA
00:12:35|00:12:39|creating videos each video with its own|NA
00:12:37|00:12:40|special Flair so it can get around the|NA
00:12:39|00:12:42|counter measures built into YouTube's|NA
00:12:40|00:12:43|system and you simply upload all these|NA
00:12:42|00:12:45|to different YouTube channels that|NA
00:12:43|00:12:47|you've created with a fake email|NA
00:12:45|00:12:49|accounts and there you go you're|NA
00:12:47|00:12:51|suddenly flooding YouTube with|NA
00:12:49|00:12:53|automatically created content that has|NA
00:12:51|00:12:55|the incentives of making you money or|NA
00:12:53|00:12:57|changing the way people think it's|NA
00:12:55|00:12:59|probably mostly financially motivated I|NA
00:12:57|00:13:01|think it's mostly financially motivated|NA
00:12:59|00:13:03|yeah I think I think Facebook has said|NA
00:13:01|00:13:04|the same thing about kind of propaganda|NA
00:13:03|00:13:07|you know a lot of the stuff on their|NA
00:13:04|00:13:08|site coordinated an authentic activity|NA
00:13:07|00:13:10|most|NA
00:13:08|00:13:13|economically motivated even during 2016|NA
00:13:10|00:13:15|you know now the notion of fake news is|NA
00:13:13|00:13:17|so tied to Russia but fake news wasn't|NA
00:13:15|00:13:20|actually about Russia if you remember|NA
00:13:17|00:13:23|back in 2016 during the campaign it was|NA
00:13:20|00:13:26|about people just creating these|NA
00:13:23|00:13:28|hyper-partisan sites that were literally|NA
00:13:26|00:13:30|fake news to monster they faked open|NA
00:13:28|00:13:31|endorses Donald Trump and this kind of|NA
00:13:30|00:13:33|stuff and it was just pushing people to|NA
00:13:31|00:13:36|the sites to try to make money on the|NA
00:13:33|00:13:38|ads and so that's what I think a lot of|NA
00:13:36|00:13:42|a lot of the challenge here is the|NA
00:13:38|00:13:44|really strong actors the nation states|NA
00:13:42|00:13:46|that are trying to to do this kind of|NA
00:13:44|00:13:48|stuff will spend the years to build up|NA
00:13:46|00:13:49|the audiences over time and then you|NA
00:13:48|00:13:52|have these kind of more fly-by-night|NA
00:13:49|00:13:52|operations where a blog you know blog|NA
00:13:52|00:13:54|spins up overnight|NA
00:13:52|00:13:56|they game their way into distribution|NA
00:13:54|00:13:59|and then they just make money on the ads|NA
00:13:56|00:14:01|someone that's doing this this|NA
00:13:59|00:14:03|subversive activity if they're doing it|NA
00:14:01|00:14:05|well we're not going to know right for a|NA
00:14:03|00:14:08|long time for a long time so it's and I|NA
00:14:05|00:14:10|make a mistake yeah it's happening right|NA
00:14:08|00:14:12|now probably in the sidebar of this|NA
00:14:10|00:14:16|video people are watching right now we|NA
00:14:12|00:14:19|just may not know that it's it's a|NA
00:14:16|00:14:22|inauthentic behavior I think it's really|NA
00:14:19|00:14:23|hard to find the stuff it gets better|NA
00:14:22|00:14:26|and better that's the other thing I|NA
00:14:23|00:14:30|think people assume that it's obviously|NA
00:14:26|00:14:32|obviously fake or obviously you know|NA
00:14:30|00:14:34|obviously incorrect English or obviously|NA
00:14:32|00:14:36|sensationalist memes or something like|NA
00:14:34|00:14:37|that no they actually just started|NA
00:14:36|00:14:42|repurposing their content from our own|NA
00:14:37|00:14:44|real authentic hyper-partisan pages can|NA
00:14:42|00:14:46|we just stop and be disturbed that this|NA
00:14:44|00:14:48|is the kind of content that's getting|NA
00:14:46|00:14:50|real eyeballs and I know what you might|NA
00:14:48|00:14:52|be thinking well it's clearly different|NA
00:14:50|00:14:54|I could tell the difference in that but|NA
00:14:52|00:14:56|think about Who I am right I'm an|NA
00:14:54|00:14:58|engineer who understands countermeasures|NA
00:14:56|00:15:00|I think through strategy I spend|NA
00:14:58|00:15:02|hundreds of hours a month thinking about|NA
00:15:00|00:15:04|the YouTube algorithm I tailor my|NA
00:15:02|00:15:08|thumbnails I understand how titles work|NA
00:15:04|00:15:10|all of this to say I still got tricked|NA
00:15:08|00:15:11|and so it's a cat-and-mouse game well|NA
00:15:10|00:15:13|basically you have offensive content|NA
00:15:11|00:15:14|then you have a countermeasure and then|NA
00:15:13|00:15:16|you have a counter countermeasure yes|NA
00:15:14|00:15:17|and then the YouTube engineers have to|NA
00:15:16|00:15:19|develop a counter counter|NA
00:15:17|00:15:21|countermeasure and so this just|NA
00:15:19|00:15:24|continuously ratchets up and I don't see|NA
00:15:21|00:15:26|a way to win you're not gonna win this|NA
00:15:24|00:15:29|no you're never gonna win there's no|NA
00:15:26|00:15:32|winning do managing increase the costs|NA
00:15:29|00:15:32|for the adversary to influence society|NA
00:15:32|00:15:34|yes|NA
00:15:32|00:15:35|regardless of whether this material is|NA
00:15:34|00:15:37|made in some far-off land to make a|NA
00:15:35|00:15:39|quick buck or if it's from a malicious|NA
00:15:37|00:15:42|nation trying to influence a foreign|NA
00:15:39|00:15:46|election it's all taking advantage of|NA
00:15:42|00:15:49|this flaw in your heart the desire to|NA
00:15:46|00:15:51|fight with your neighbor these people|NA
00:15:49|00:15:53|literally make us hate each other and|NA
00:15:51|00:15:55|then we turn around and give them our|NA
00:15:53|00:15:57|money if your first inclination is to be|NA
00:15:55|00:15:59|mad at YouTube right now and some kind|NA
00:15:57|00:16:01|of outrage then you don't get it like|NA
00:15:59|00:16:03|you don't see what's happening here I|NA
00:16:01|00:16:05|know these engineers they're using all|NA
00:16:03|00:16:07|the math at their disposal to try to fix|NA
00:16:05|00:16:09|this as desperately as they can but|NA
00:16:07|00:16:11|until our hearts changed towards|NA
00:16:09|00:16:13|political grace these people are going|NA
00:16:11|00:16:14|to keep taking advantage of us I don't|NA
00:16:13|00:16:17|care what kind of laws we make to try to|NA
00:16:14|00:16:19|get around this they're going to make us|NA
00:16:17|00:16:21|fight and we're gonna sit there and do|NA
00:16:19|00:16:23|it and then close our eyes and give them|NA
00:16:21|00:16:25|our money we've got to be smarter than|NA
00:16:23|00:16:26|this I think a lot of the countering has|NA
00:16:25|00:16:30|to be done in the real world right it's|NA
00:16:26|00:16:31|the I think you had said this in a turn|NA
00:16:30|00:16:36|of 30 years I'd read where you talked|NA
00:16:31|00:16:38|about the need to actively practice love|NA
00:16:36|00:16:41|that neighborhoods right right I think|NA
00:16:38|00:16:44|that that's unfortunately it is a|NA
00:16:41|00:16:45|they're preying on human biases this is|NA
00:16:44|00:16:47|the thing we have a brand-new|NA
00:16:45|00:16:49|information ecosystem right we have|NA
00:16:47|00:16:51|democratized creation of content we have|NA
00:16:49|00:16:53|no more gatekeepers anyone can say what|NA
00:16:51|00:16:55|they want do what they want and maximize|NA
00:16:53|00:16:57|expression algorithms to help you find|NA
00:16:55|00:17:01|people but ultimately like human nature|NA
00:16:57|00:17:03|like the people have not changed so it's|NA
00:17:01|00:17:04|this fascinating new information|NA
00:17:03|00:17:08|environment and ecosystem but with a|NA
00:17:04|00:17:10|very old set of biases and and ways of|NA
00:17:08|00:17:11|being that are just kind of part of the|NA
00:17:10|00:17:15|human experience and I don't think we're|NA
00:17:11|00:17:17|necessarily adept at recognizing what|NA
00:17:15|00:17:19|social media has done to us as|NA
00:17:17|00:17:21|individuals and as members of society|NA
00:17:19|00:17:25|and that I think is one of the the key|NA
00:17:21|00:17:27|challenges where no amount of regulating|NA
00:17:25|00:17:30|of algorithms or catching of bad guys|NA
00:17:27|00:17:31|changes that kind of fundamental truth|NA
00:17:30|00:17:35|trying|NA
00:17:31|00:17:39|use real community to kind of return|NA
00:17:35|00:17:40|people to that human connection is the|NA
00:17:39|00:17:43|the thing that we're missing right now|NA
00:17:40|00:17:45|that's because it's much harder to to do|NA
00:17:43|00:17:47|that to create the kind of act of unity|NA
00:17:45|00:17:49|that you're talking about because like|NA
00:17:47|00:17:51|who's in charge of doing that normally|NA
00:17:49|00:17:54|that would have been like your churches|NA
00:17:51|00:17:56|or neighborhood your community I think I|NA
00:17:54|00:17:58|don't know what that looks like|NA
00:17:56|00:18:00|ported online where everybody spending|NA
00:17:58|00:18:02|their time I'm not trying to scare you|NA
00:18:00|00:18:04|by showing you all this stuff obviously|NA
00:18:02|00:18:06|there's a lot of hard core engineering|NA
00:18:04|00:18:08|thought that goes into everything I just|NA
00:18:06|00:18:10|showed you but it's happening there are|NA
00:18:08|00:18:13|bad actors trying to manipulate people|NA
00:18:10|00:18:14|online for financial gain and I don't|NA
00:18:13|00:18:16|think it's YouTube's fault when somebody|NA
00:18:14|00:18:18|wants to do bad things to you they're|NA
00:18:16|00:18:21|gonna do whatever they can to get your|A
00:18:18|00:18:22|data and exploit it what I realized this|A
00:18:21|00:18:24|series was going to help educate people|A
00:18:22|00:18:26|I reached out to a company that takes|A
00:18:24|00:18:29|online internet security seriously and|A
00:18:26|00:18:31|that is expressvpn they were all in they|A
00:18:29|00:18:32|decided to sponsor this video series and|A
00:18:31|00:18:34|helped make it happen if you're not|A
00:18:32|00:18:36|using a VPN you seriously need to|A
00:18:34|00:18:38|consider it your internet connection|A
00:18:36|00:18:40|right now is broadcasting your IP|A
00:18:38|00:18:42|address which is the way people track|A
00:18:40|00:18:44|you online check this out when I go to|A
00:18:42|00:18:45|this website it tests everything that my|A
00:18:44|00:18:47|internet connection is leaking and you|A
00:18:45|00:18:48|can see my IP address which I've masked|A
00:18:47|00:18:51|here because I don't want you to see it|A
00:18:48|00:18:53|but you can also see where I'm at your|A
00:18:51|00:18:55|internet connection is doing this right|A
00:18:53|00:18:57|now here's how expressvpn works it's a|A

00:19:48|00:19:52|talk to some of the engineers in charge|NA
00:19:50|00:19:54|of building these countermeasures it is|NA
00:19:52|00:19:56|a fascinating discussion I hope you'll|NA

00:20:15|00:20:18|day have a good one </st>|NA
00:00:00|00:00:02|<st> I want to tell you about a very famous|NA
00:00:00|00:00:04|number that you've heard about before|NA
00:00:02|00:00:06|but I'll tell you why it is what it is|NA
00:00:04|00:00:07|and it's the golden ratio a lot of|NA
00:00:06|00:00:08|people think the golden ratio is this|NA
00:00:07|00:00:10|mystical thing it is but not for the|NA
00:00:08|00:00:12|reasons they think but I want to do that|NA
00:00:10|00:00:14|and I tell you why it's interesting when|NA
00:00:12|00:00:15|I do that through a mechanism of flowers|NA
00:00:14|00:00:16|and you may have heard a connection with|NA
00:00:15|00:00:18|the coordination flowers before but I'll|NA
00:00:16|00:00:19|show you why that connection is there|NA
00:00:18|00:00:21|for the sake of this nobody I'll I'll be|NA
00:00:19|00:00:23|the scribe but I'd like you to imagine|NA
00:00:21|00:00:25|Brady that you are a flower your job as|NA
00:00:23|00:00:26|a flower is to deal with your seeds it's|NA
00:00:25|00:00:27|kind of the job of everything living|NA
00:00:26|00:00:28|you're gonna grow some seeds and we're|NA
00:00:27|00:00:29|gonna model this flower in a|NA
00:00:28|00:00:31|mathematical way|NA
00:00:29|00:00:32|this is not how flowers actually grow|NA
00:00:31|00:00:34|but there are connections this is the|NA
00:00:32|00:00:35|center when you grow a seed I'm gonna|NA
00:00:34|00:00:37|represent that by putting a little blob|NA
00:00:35|00:00:39|that's a seed that you've going from the|NA
00:00:37|00:00:40|center of your flower and one option you|NA
00:00:39|00:00:41|could have is is you've got it so where|NA
00:00:40|00:00:44|to put your seeds and I'm gonna give you|NA
00:00:41|00:00:46|the option of only how much do you turn|NA
00:00:44|00:00:48|around before you grow your next seed so|NA
00:00:46|00:00:51|you put a seed down and you could turn a|NA
00:00:48|00:00:52|bit and put another seat down kind of|NA
00:00:51|00:00:54|growing it if you don't turn at all|NA
00:00:52|00:00:55|you're gonna grow seeds out like this|NA
00:00:54|00:00:56|the first he goes there if you don't|NA
00:00:55|00:00:58|turn the next he goes next to it then if|NA
00:00:56|00:00:59|one goes next to it you're gonna grow|NA
00:00:58|00:01:00|the seeds out there and you're gonna|NA
00:00:59|00:01:02|push seeds out actually I'm adding them|NA
00:01:00|00:01:03|on the end but it grow from there and|NA
00:01:02|00:01:05|push this seeds out on the line this is|NA
00:01:03|00:01:06|a really bad arrangement for a flower I|NA
00:01:05|00:01:08|hope you agree and I hope you weren't|NA
00:01:06|00:01:11|imagining this when you were thinking of|NA
00:01:08|00:01:14|a flower yeah there's a whole bunch of|NA
00:01:11|00:01:15|circle unused so the obvious thing if|NA
00:01:14|00:01:17|I'm gonna do this model of like if a|NA
00:01:15|00:01:18|flower could just grow by putting a seed|NA
00:01:17|00:01:20|in and turning a bit what would happen|NA
00:01:18|00:01:22|if you turn an amount of a turn so I'm|NA
00:01:20|00:01:24|gonna talk about fractions of turns this|NA
00:01:22|00:01:26|is a fraction return of zero if you do|NA
00:01:24|00:01:27|no one here with an you turn half a turn|NA
00:01:26|00:01:29|each time then if the first seed goes|NA
00:01:27|00:01:31|here then I think if you turn half turn|NA
00:01:29|00:01:33|the next one's gonna go there if you|NA
00:01:31|00:01:34|don't half turn again keep UN same|NA
00:01:33|00:01:37|direction it's gonna go there and there|NA
00:01:34|00:01:39|and this is also not exciting being kind|NA
00:01:37|00:01:41|of see why the decision of turning a|NA
00:01:39|00:01:43|half has made two lines and maybe gonna|NA
00:01:41|00:01:44|call these spokes because just to get|NA
00:01:43|00:01:46|you in the mood Lister third you could|NA
00:01:44|00:01:47|probably predict it pretty easily see|NA
00:01:46|00:01:49|turn that third of a turn or roughly|NA
00:01:47|00:01:51|there third of a turn roughly there and|NA
00:01:49|00:01:54|you're gonna see these three spokes|NA
00:01:51|00:01:55|sticking out pretty easily happy enough|NA
00:01:54|00:01:56|with this I mean these none of these are|NA
00:01:55|00:01:58|good flower designs but the consequences|NA
00:01:56|00:02:01|of choosing a number is giving you some|NA
00:01:58|00:02:04|patterns so if I jump say to a tenth of|NA
00:02:01|00:02:07|a turn would you care to predict what|NA
00:02:04|00:02:09|you'd see yeah and so I don't think the|NA
00:02:07|00:02:11|the spoke behavior is very surprising|NA
00:02:09|00:02:11|and it looks like the denominator of|NA
00:02:11|00:02:13|this|NA
00:02:11|00:02:14|fraction of attorneys controlling|NA
00:02:13|00:02:16|everything now I think it's much less|NA
00:02:14|00:02:19|obvious if I told you what would happen|NA
00:02:16|00:02:20|three tenths so with three tenths if you|NA
00:02:19|00:02:22|start here you have three tenths of a|NA
00:02:20|00:02:24|turn you'd skip a couple of the branches|NA
00:02:22|00:02:26|and then that another three tenths you'd|NA
00:02:24|00:02:27|skip a couple you get on here three|NA
00:02:26|00:02:29|tenths you'd skip a couple go here and|NA
00:02:27|00:02:30|if you keep going around you'll end up|NA
00:02:29|00:02:32|not repeating yourself for a bit until|NA
00:02:30|00:02:33|all ten are done|NA
00:02:32|00:02:34|you also get tens books so there's this|NA
00:02:33|00:02:36|really nice thing in mathematics called|NA
00:02:34|00:02:37|a conjecture we pretty much have one|NA
00:02:36|00:02:39|here looks like it's the denominator of|NA
00:02:37|00:02:41|the fraction is controlling number|NA
00:02:39|00:02:42|spokes so here's a quick computer model|NA
00:02:41|00:02:44|of what we've been talking about and we|NA
00:02:42|00:02:45|can check that with other tests before I|NA
00:02:44|00:02:48|have 11 you may want to predict what|NA
00:02:45|00:02:49|happens you're correct there 11 spokes|NA
00:02:48|00:02:52|if you type in some other numbers there|NA
00:02:49|00:02:54|are some surprises so I do 11 out of 23|NA
00:02:52|00:02:55|you do get 23 spokes but there's some|NA
00:02:54|00:02:57|interesting behavior happening in the|NA
00:02:55|00:02:58|middle and that's actually it looks like|NA
00:02:57|00:02:59|this kind of two spokes but they're kind|NA
00:02:58|00:03:01|of twisted and that's because this|NA
00:02:59|00:03:03|number is quite close to one over two|NA
00:03:01|00:03:05|and it looks like what numbers you're|NA
00:03:03|00:03:07|close to also affect what happens one|NA
00:03:05|00:03:09|surprise that you should watch out for I|NA
00:03:07|00:03:11|mean if I do seven tenths you know about|NA
00:03:09|00:03:12|tenths you get ten of them but then|NA
00:03:11|00:03:14|occasionally you catch yourself I you do|NA
00:03:12|00:03:16|four tenths same thing are ten spokes|NA
00:03:14|00:03:18|but there aren't is two-fifths and|NA
00:03:16|00:03:19|flowers can cancel fractions or all I|NA
00:03:18|00:03:21|can't actually and was it happening is|NA
00:03:19|00:03:23|that four tenths is better described by|NA
00:03:21|00:03:25|two fifths so you've seen lots of bad|NA
00:03:23|00:03:27|flowers this is pretty but it's not what|NA
00:03:25|00:03:29|flowers - what's interesting is if you|NA
00:03:27|00:03:31|change this number very very slowly and|NA
00:03:29|00:03:32|you realize that a tiny change gives you|NA
00:03:31|00:03:34|very different behavior so this number|NA
00:03:32|00:03:37|is changing ridiculously slowly but even|NA
00:03:34|00:03:39|a small jump he's giving us spirally|NA
00:03:37|00:03:43|shapes and very quickly they stop|NA
00:03:39|00:03:45|looking like suppose that the number is|NA
00:03:43|00:03:48|the fraction of a turn before I grow you|NA
00:03:45|00:03:51|see so this number that's here is is|NA
00:03:48|00:03:52|0.40 one of a turn when I go you see|NA
00:03:51|00:03:53|them that's already enough to stop it|NA
00:03:52|00:03:54|going in lines and they're starting to|NA
00:03:53|00:03:57|bunch together and this is already|NA
00:03:54|00:03:59|looking better a prettier thing for a|NA
00:03:57|00:04:00|flower it's also nicely hypnotic if you|NA
00:03:59|00:04:02|need to hypnotize people you start|NA
00:04:00|00:04:04|seeing things kind of turning one way|NA
00:04:02|00:04:06|but also maybe turning the other way you|NA
00:04:04|00:04:10|see spokes arriving and disappearing and|NA
00:04:06|00:04:12|this is already a better flower I'm|NA
00:04:10|00:04:13|using it much more efficiently now I'm|NA
00:04:12|00:04:15|not saying flowers are thinking about|NA
00:04:13|00:04:16|this there's some how they do this|NA
00:04:15|00:04:18|efficiently and we've got now an obvious|NA
00:04:16|00:04:20|question is is there a fraction of a|NA
00:04:18|00:04:21|turn that is an efficient one what's|NA
00:04:20|00:04:23|really lovely about this is you can see|NA
00:04:21|00:04:24|rational numbers arriving you can see|NA
00:04:23|00:04:26|that I'm not out of fur|NA
00:04:24|00:04:27|but already the number three is|NA
00:04:26|00:04:29|dominating everything it's like hunting|NA
00:04:27|00:04:30|for big game you can hear these animals|NA
00:04:29|00:04:32|coming in the undergrowth you see it|NA
00:04:30|00:04:34|this third is about to arrive or at|NA
00:04:32|00:04:36|0.329 now and as soon as we hit exactly|NA
00:04:34|00:04:37|a third we're gonna get those three|NA
00:04:36|00:04:39|spokes and it's really nice to see it|NA
00:04:37|00:04:40|arrive and then disappear so it's about|NA
00:04:39|00:04:42|to get there as soon as we hit point two|NA
00:04:40|00:04:43|three three three three two exactly as|NA
00:04:42|00:04:46|long as the cows on forever you will see|NA
00:04:43|00:04:48|our three spokes and then it's gone|NA
00:04:46|00:04:50|we're in two other numbers if you put a|NA
00:04:48|00:04:52|number in for a fraction of a turn and|NA
00:04:50|00:04:53|it is a fraction ie hasn't denominated|NA
00:04:52|00:04:55|it's gonna give you spokes and so maybe|NA
00:04:53|00:04:58|we're into familiar territory from many|NA
00:04:55|00:04:59|other discussions about numbers maybe|NA
00:04:58|00:05:00|you could suggest a number greater you|NA
00:04:59|00:05:04|could type in that wouldn't give me|NA
00:05:00|00:05:06|spokes which is the square root of two|NA
00:05:04|00:05:09|what do you think you're gonna see kind|NA
00:05:06|00:05:11|of spirally spirals oh it looks less|NA
00:05:09|00:05:13|like it's got spokes but you can't kind|NA
00:05:11|00:05:14|of count them and it turns out that this|NA
00:05:13|00:05:16|is definitely an irrational number I'm|NA
00:05:14|00:05:17|approximating an irrational number on|NA
00:05:16|00:05:19|computer but this arrangement looks much|NA
00:05:17|00:05:21|better so it sounds like you've you've|NA
00:05:19|00:05:22|hit upon the idea of maybe flowers need|NA
00:05:21|00:05:24|to turn it irrational amount of a turn|NA
00:05:22|00:05:26|but there are the irrational numbers I'm|NA
00:05:24|00:05:27|gonna type in 1 over PI because PI's a|NA
00:05:26|00:05:29|lot of people's favorite here of|NA
00:05:27|00:05:30|rational number this surprised me think|NA
00:05:29|00:05:32|about what you might see we know it|NA
00:05:30|00:05:34|can't produce spokes because pi is|NA
00:05:32|00:05:35|irrational now they're not quite spokes|NA
00:05:34|00:05:37|but they're slightly curved spokes and|NA
00:05:35|00:05:39|there are in fact 22 of them just to|NA
00:05:37|00:05:42|save you counting I don't know if 22|NA
00:05:39|00:05:43|rings of Bell to do with PI but if the|NA
00:05:42|00:05:45|older generation needs to get toward|NA
00:05:43|00:05:48|their pi was pretty much exactly the|NA
00:05:45|00:05:50|ratio 22 over 7 it's not quite but it's|NA
00:05:48|00:05:51|unreasonably good and you can see on|NA
00:05:50|00:05:53|this diagram that is unreasonably good|NA
00:05:51|00:05:54|because this is irrational but it's|NA
00:05:53|00:05:56|really well approximated by something|NA
00:05:54|00:05:57|through the number 22 in fact what I|NA
00:05:56|00:05:59|love about this diagram is you can see|NA
00:05:57|00:06:01|another approximation of Pi buried in|NA
00:05:59|00:06:03|the middle there aren't 22 spokes in the|NA
00:06:01|00:06:04|middle there are 3-3 is a very|NA
00:06:03|00:06:06|well-known approximation for pi in fact|NA
00:06:04|00:06:09|if I carried this diagram on really big|NA
00:06:06|00:06:11|you see lots of rational approximations|NA
00:06:09|00:06:13|for pi in the arrangements of seeds in a|NA
00:06:11|00:06:14|flower or a mathematical flower but what|NA
00:06:13|00:06:15|it also tells you is that pi is not very|NA
00:06:14|00:06:17|irrational|NA
00:06:15|00:06:19|it looks like root 2 is more irrational|NA
00:06:17|00:06:21|so actually the obvious question which|NA
00:06:19|00:06:22|is turned up in lots of situations and|NA
00:06:21|00:06:24|maybe in other videos from me is that is|NA
00:06:22|00:06:26|there one that's the most irrational and|NA
00:06:24|00:06:28|there is and I'll show it to you and|NA
00:06:26|00:06:30|then I'll show you why so here it is if|NA
00:06:28|00:06:32|I jump to this square root of 5 minus 1|NA
00:06:30|00:06:34|over 2 in this this is the golden ratio|NA
00:06:32|00:06:35|of a turn and what's lovely about is you|NA
00:06:34|00:06:37|can see spokes but you can see they're|NA
00:06:35|00:06:38|going in both directions they're kind of|NA
00:06:37|00:06:39|crossing over both ways and you could|NA
00:06:38|00:06:41|try and count them and if you do you get|NA
00:06:39|00:06:43|Fibonacci numbers and if you go and look|NA
00:06:41|00:06:45|in the real world this is the bit a lot|NA
00:06:43|00:06:46|of people claim is that this is what|NA
00:06:45|00:06:48|sunflowers do so if I hide the seeds|NA
00:06:46|00:06:49|there that's the arrangement of seeds in|NA
00:06:48|00:06:50|the head of a sunflower|NA
00:06:49|00:06:52|that's not generated by a computer this|NA
00:06:50|00:06:53|is a flower doing something to be|NA
00:06:52|00:06:55|efficient and if I put the seeds back|NA
00:06:53|00:06:57|and hide it the the correlation between|NA
00:06:55|00:06:58|those placements is is almost|NA
00:06:57|00:06:59|frightening and what's lovely bad is|NA
00:06:58|00:07:01|that no other number works so if I start|NA
00:06:59|00:07:03|this animating again not the spokes are|NA
00:07:01|00:07:04|obvious and this kind of unravels and|NA
00:07:03|00:07:06|already you can see these spokes|NA
00:07:04|00:07:07|unraveling and they're obvious spokes we|NA
00:07:06|00:07:09|could count the spokes and figure out|NA
00:07:07|00:07:10|what rational number was near so the|NA
00:07:09|00:07:12|golden ratio looks like it's the best|NA
00:07:10|00:07:13|one but I want to show you on paper why|NA
00:07:12|00:07:15|is the best one and I'm gonna do that by|NA
00:07:13|00:07:17|starting with pi because it's a good|NA
00:07:15|00:07:19|place to start but pi is an irrational|NA
00:07:17|00:07:21|number that apparently is not very|NA
00:07:19|00:07:23|irrational and we kind of already know|NA
00:07:21|00:07:25|that it's approximated well by a|NA
00:07:23|00:07:26|rational number but let me show you how|NA
00:07:25|00:07:28|you can sort of quantify that so I'm|NA
00:07:26|00:07:30|gonna say that's high is three plus a|NA
00:07:28|00:07:31|bit I don't think that's controversial|NA
00:07:30|00:07:33|but what I'm interested in is writing|NA
00:07:31|00:07:35|this number pi which I can never really|NA
00:07:33|00:07:36|write down a full which is why we have|NA
00:07:35|00:07:38|the symbol for it can I write it in a|NA
00:07:36|00:07:40|way which looks more like a fraction|NA
00:07:38|00:07:41|instead of like a decimal so 3 plus a|NA
00:07:40|00:07:43|bit isn't very helpful but I could sage|NA
00:07:41|00:07:45|since this bit is less than 1 otherwise|NA
00:07:43|00:07:47|it could be 4 plus a bit right then I|NA
00:07:45|00:07:49|could say this is 3 plus 1 over|NA
00:07:47|00:07:51|something and I could find out what that|NA
00:07:49|00:07:52|something is on a calculator I could|NA
00:07:51|00:07:54|take away the 3 and I get into something|NA
00:07:52|00:07:56|and then I could do 1 over there or X to|NA
00:07:54|00:07:58|the minus 1 to find out what it is and|NA
00:07:56|00:08:00|it actually is seven point something so|NA
00:07:58|00:08:01|I'm gonna write this 1 over 7 plus a bit|NA
00:08:00|00:08:03|the words a bit are not sort of|NA
00:08:01|00:08:04|mathematically recognised terminology|NA
00:08:03|00:08:07|but you get the idea so I could carry on|NA
00:08:04|00:08:08|I know this 3 plus 1 over 7 plus a bit|NA
00:08:07|00:08:10|and I could write that as 1 over|NA
00:08:08|00:08:11|something and that's on my screen now so|NA
00:08:10|00:08:15|I could take away the the 7 and get the|NA
00:08:11|00:08:17|bit and do 1 over that and I get 15 and|NA
00:08:15|00:08:18|a bit I can start writing 15 plus a bit|NA
00:08:17|00:08:19|instead of doing me a bit now I'm just|NA
00:08:18|00:08:24|gonna go straight in with 1 over|NA
00:08:19|00:08:25|something take away 15 get the bit X to|NA
00:08:24|00:08:29|the minus 1 do 1 over it and they get|NA
00:08:25|00:08:31|one and a bit take away 1 through the|NA
00:08:29|00:08:33|bits a very small bit this time and I|NA
00:08:31|00:08:35|get to 9 2 and you can see that if this|NA
00:08:33|00:08:37|number is truly irrational I could just|NA
00:08:35|00:08:39|keep going and actually this thing here|NA
00:08:37|00:08:40|is called the continued fraction for pi|NA
00:08:39|00:08:42|and something very obvious happens with|NA
00:08:40|00:08:43|the PI is that you get a very small|NA
00:08:42|00:08:44|number here then you get a very large|NA
00:08:43|00:08:46|number here in the trade they call it|NA
00:08:44|00:08:47|truncating but if you chop the continued|NA
00:08:46|00:08:49|fraction its own|NA
00:08:47|00:08:51|you'll get an approximation so three and|NA
00:08:49|00:08:53|a seventh is 22 over 7 it's a good|NA
00:08:51|00:08:54|approximation for pi if you're talking|NA
00:08:53|00:08:57|there you get a approximation if you|NA
00:08:54|00:08:58|chop it there I'll chop it there but|NA
00:08:57|00:09:00|because this number is massive|NA
00:08:58|00:09:06|and it's one over that number this|NA
00:09:00|00:09:07|additional bit is tiny well actually|NA
00:09:06|00:09:09|after that goes back to being someone's|NA
00:09:07|00:09:11|in the continued fraction but that|NA
00:09:09|00:09:12|particular point it means that you don't|NA
00:09:11|00:09:14|add very much accuracy at those two|NA
00:09:12|00:09:15|levels truncation which means it was|NA
00:09:14|00:09:17|really accurate before which means the|NA
00:09:15|00:09:21|step before that was ridiculously good|NA
00:09:17|00:09:22|which means pi is well approximated|NA
00:09:21|00:09:24|quite early on by a rational number|NA
00:09:22|00:09:25|which is why I'm gonna claim it's not|NA
00:09:24|00:09:27|very irrational and why when you saw the|NA
00:09:25|00:09:29|diagram of it looks like ants pokes so|NA
00:09:27|00:09:30|looking in the continued fraction the|NA
00:09:29|00:09:31|question is what would the most|NA
00:09:30|00:09:33|irrational number look like it would be|NA
00:09:31|00:09:35|the one with a continued fraction that|NA
00:09:33|00:09:36|doesn't have any large numbers in it so|NA
00:09:35|00:09:38|I'm gonna claim that this is a pretty|NA
00:09:36|00:09:39|good candidate I'm gonna call it X so|NA
00:09:38|00:09:40|the continued fraction would be let's|NA
00:09:39|00:09:41|just start with one|NA
00:09:40|00:09:44|but then the continued fraction would go|NA
00:09:41|00:09:46|one over the smallest whole number one I|NA
00:09:44|00:09:48|know have one here I don't have a one|NA
00:09:46|00:09:49|here I have a one here and this is|NA
00:09:48|00:09:51|something that a lot of people do|NA
00:09:49|00:09:53|recognize it's an odd thing to ask what|NA
00:09:51|00:09:54|it is but whatever it is it will be|NA
00:09:53|00:09:56|badly approximated anytime you truncate|NA
00:09:54|00:09:58|it because these numbers are small now|NA
00:09:56|00:10:00|just as a little heads up I'm just gonna|NA
00:09:58|00:10:02|tell you the root two has a continued|NA
00:10:00|00:10:06|fraction as well one plus one over two|NA
00:10:02|00:10:07|plus tonight with two two two and it|NA
00:10:06|00:10:09|carries on like that which is|NA
00:10:07|00:10:10|incidentally why root two looked pretty|NA
00:10:09|00:10:12|good on our diagram because although|NA
00:10:10|00:10:13|these are not the smallest numbers this|NA
00:10:12|00:10:14|they're consistent and they stay small|NA
00:10:13|00:10:16|what I want to get through with this|NA
00:10:14|00:10:18|video you might know the answer but I|NA
00:10:16|00:10:20|want to prove it is what is this number|NA
00:10:18|00:10:21|I'm gonna solve this this is an infinite|NA
00:10:20|00:10:24|thing but we can solve this surprisingly|NA
00:10:21|00:10:25|easy because it carries on forever let|NA
00:10:24|00:10:27|me point out something which i think is|NA
00:10:25|00:10:29|obvious when someone points it out which|NA
00:10:27|00:10:30|is that this thing is the same as the|NA
00:10:29|00:10:32|whole thing it is X which means I can|NA
00:10:30|00:10:34|sort of grab that thing and call it X I|NA
00:10:32|00:10:38|can rewrite equation as x equals 1 plus|NA
00:10:34|00:10:40|1 over X and that looks much less scary|NA
00:10:38|00:10:42|in fact it's a quadratic equation which|NA
00:10:40|00:10:43|I'm gonna solve I'm sure people watching|NA
00:10:42|00:10:45|this video would have their favorite way|NA
00:10:43|00:10:47|of solving quadratics I'm gonna do maybe|NA
00:10:45|00:10:49|not quite the quadratic formula I've|NA
00:10:47|00:10:50|seen a friend of mine called Matt Parker|NA
00:10:49|00:10:52|try this with a quadratic formula|NA
00:10:50|00:10:55|there's a better way I'm multiplying by|NA
00:10:52|00:10:57|X to get x squared equals x plus 1 I'm|NA
00:10:55|00:10:59|gonna rearrange it onto one side over x|NA
00:10:57|00:11:01|squared minus X minus|NA
00:10:59|00:11:02|one equals zero at this point a lot of|NA
00:11:01|00:11:04|people reach for the quadratic formula|NA
00:11:02|00:11:05|that minus B plus or minus the square|NA
00:11:04|00:11:08|root I'm gonna complete this square|NA
00:11:05|00:11:10|which is where the formula comes from so|NA
00:11:08|00:11:13|I'm gonna realize that if I write X|NA
00:11:10|00:11:15|minus 1/2 squared that would square to|NA
00:11:13|00:11:17|give me an x squared it would also give|NA
00:11:15|00:11:19|me the minus X I need try if you don't|NA
00:11:17|00:11:20|believe it but it'll create a quarter|NA
00:11:19|00:11:24|which I don't want from the 1/2 squared|NA
00:11:20|00:11:26|and I still got a minus 1 here I'm just|NA
00:11:24|00:11:29|gonna carry on putting this stuff on the|NA
00:11:26|00:11:31|other side I get X minus 1/2 squared|NA
00:11:29|00:11:34|equals combined in these I'm gonna get 5|NA
00:11:31|00:11:35|over 4 and now I can square root it this|NA
00:11:34|00:11:38|is the whole point of completing the|NA
00:11:35|00:11:41|square X minus 1/2 equals plus or minus|NA
00:11:38|00:11:43|the square root of 5 good at square root|NA
00:11:41|00:11:45|of 5 over 2 because that's the square|NA
00:11:43|00:11:48|root 4 and I'm gonna do one more step|NA
00:11:45|00:11:56|and this needs a box because x equals|NA
00:11:48|00:11:59|put this half on the other side that's|NA
00:11:56|00:12:01|the same thing and this is equal to Phi|NA
00:11:59|00:12:02|which is the golden ratio and it is the|NA
00:12:01|00:12:04|most irrational number because of the|NA
00:12:02|00:12:07|way it builds as a continued fraction|NA
00:12:04|00:12:09|which is why it looks so nice when you|NA
00:12:07|00:12:10|stack it around a sunflower and why it|NA
00:12:09|00:12:11|carves a path through an infinite|NA
00:12:10|00:12:13|orchard if anyone ever talked to you|NA
00:12:11|00:12:14|about that that is farthest away from|NA
00:12:13|00:12:16|all the other points and that's why Phi|NA
00:12:14|00:12:17|is a cool number it's not because the|NA
00:12:16|00:12:21|Greeks designed the Parthenon to look|NA
00:12:17|00:12:24|like it because that was not true I|NA
00:12:21|00:12:25|haven't done the job so which one is it|NA
00:12:24|00:12:27|let me show you on a calculator if you|NA
00:12:25|00:12:29|if you tap this in obviously this is|NA
00:12:27|00:12:31|gonna give us an approximation but if I|NA
00:12:29|00:12:32|do 1 plus the square root of 5 and|NA
00:12:31|00:12:35|divide it by 2|NA
00:12:32|00:12:38|I'll get a familiar number which is one|NA
00:12:35|00:12:41|point four six one eight oh three 3 9|NA
00:12:38|00:12:43|and so on now that is a familiar number|NA
00:12:41|00:12:45|the golden ratio but if I did 1 minus it|NA
00:12:43|00:12:46|and 1 minus the square root of 5 which|NA
00:12:45|00:12:51|is the other option I had and divided by|NA
00:12:46|00:12:54|2 I get negative zero point six one|NA
00:12:51|00:12:55|eight four zero three three nine and|NA
00:12:54|00:12:57|actually get the same decimal expansion|NA
00:12:55|00:12:58|it just happens to be negative and this|NA
00:12:57|00:13:00|is all because of the property of the|NA
00:12:58|00:13:02|golden ratio that if you take away one|NA
00:13:00|00:13:04|from it you get 1 over itself and that's|NA
00:13:02|00:13:06|actually built into this equation and if|NA
00:13:04|00:13:09|you make it negative you can get|NA
00:13:06|00:13:10|reciprocals of itself so either of those|NA
00:13:09|00:13:12|numbers are Leia claimed to be the|NA
00:13:10|00:13:12|golden ratio and when I did it on the|NA
00:13:12|00:13:16|sunflower|NA
00:13:12|00:13:19|I actually used 0.618 0 339 because that|NA
00:13:16|00:13:21|gave me a fraction between 0 and 1 but|NA
00:13:19|00:13:24|they kind of all gone ratio or directly|NA

00:00:22|00:00:25|hey what's going on guys so in this|NA
00:00:24|00:00:28|video we're gonna create three different|NA
00:00:25|00:00:31|CSS loaders using a little bit of|NA
00:00:28|00:00:33|animation and these three were inspired|NA
00:00:31|00:00:35|by a couple different code pens and I'll|NA
00:00:33|00:00:37|put those links in the description but|NA
00:00:35|00:00:39|basically I have the first one here if I|NA
00:00:37|00:00:42|reload it's gonna be these three hours|NA
00:00:39|00:00:45|I'm sorry these two circles that kind of|NA
00:00:42|00:00:47|revolve and change sizes and runs for|NA
00:00:45|00:00:48|about four seconds and then the main|NA
00:00:47|00:00:50|content comes in|NA
00:00:48|00:00:52|now this little landing page here we're|NA
00:00:50|00:00:54|not going to do this till the very end|NA
00:00:52|00:00:57|the main point of this is creating the|NA
00:00:54|00:00:59|loaders but I did want to have it you|NA
00:00:57|00:01:01|know give the effect that the page was|NA
00:00:59|00:01:02|actually loading so we'll add a little|NA
00:01:01|00:01:05|bit of JavaScript at the end to do that|NA
00:01:02|00:01:08|so the second one is going to be the|NA
00:01:05|00:01:10|text loading with three dots that come|NA
00:01:08|00:01:12|in one by one okay so that's gonna be|NA
00:01:10|00:01:15|the second one and then the last one is|NA
00:01:12|00:01:18|going to be these three circles that|NA
00:01:15|00:01:20|just kind of bounce so that'll be the|NA
00:01:18|00:01:22|third one alright and they're all the|NA
00:01:20|00:01:24|same color scheme what we're gonna do is|NA
00:01:22|00:01:26|just have separate CSS files for each|NA
00:01:24|00:01:29|loader and you can use these when you're|NA
00:01:26|00:01:31|fetching data from an API for instance|NA
00:01:29|00:01:33|something that you know that takes a|NA
00:01:31|00:01:35|little bit of time or you could just add|NA
00:01:33|00:01:37|it like we're doing here and just have a|NA
00:01:35|00:01:39|little effect for your website even|NA
00:01:37|00:01:41|though you don't need it it's just a|NA
00:01:39|00:01:43|nice little effect for for your users|NA
00:01:41|00:01:44|all right so let's jump in and get|NA
00:01:43|00:01:46|started all right so we're gonna get|NA
00:01:44|00:01:48|started here I just want to go over the|NA
00:01:46|00:01:51|structure real quick I don't have any|NA
00:01:48|00:01:53|code written at all I just created the|NA
00:01:51|00:01:57|files so we have an index.html we have|NA
00:01:53|00:02:00|inside our CSS folder a style dot CSS|NA
00:01:57|00:02:02|and then loader one two and three dot|NA
00:02:00|00:02:05|CSS so we can separate the styling for|NA
00:02:02|00:02:08|each loader and we can see one at a time|NA
00:02:05|00:02:10|and then I just have a main J s inside|NA
00:02:08|00:02:11|of a j/s folder and that's where|NA
00:02:10|00:02:14|we're gonna add the set timeout so we|NA
00:02:11|00:02:16|can bring in the content okay so let's|NA
00:02:14|00:02:19|start off with our HTML I'm gonna just|NA
00:02:16|00:02:24|put in a boilerplate here and let's|NA
00:02:19|00:02:28|change the title to CSS loaders and then|NA
00:02:24|00:02:32|I'm gonna bring in let's bring in our|NA
00:02:28|00:02:35|main stylesheet so CSS slash style.css|NA
00:02:32|00:02:36|and then let's also bring in loader 1|NA
00:02:35|00:02:40|since that's what we're working with|NA
00:02:36|00:02:42|first and then in the HTML for load of 1|NA
00:02:40|00:02:45|we need to have a div with the class of|NA
00:02:42|00:02:47|loader they're actually all gonna have a|NA
00:02:45|00:02:50|class of loader but for this one we're|NA
00:02:47|00:02:52|also gonna have two divs inside with the|NA
00:02:50|00:02:55|class of circle because if you remember|NA
00:02:52|00:02:57|they're the two circles that basically|NA
00:02:55|00:03:01|rotate and change sizes as they rotate|NA
00:02:57|00:03:03|they scale up so let's save that we're|NA
00:03:01|00:03:06|not gonna add the like the paragraph and|NA
00:03:03|00:03:09|the heading and stuff until until last|NA
00:03:06|00:03:13|so now let's open this I'm gonna run it|NA
00:03:09|00:03:15|with live server and obviously we don't|NA
00:03:13|00:03:17|have anything here it's just blank but|NA
00:03:15|00:03:20|let's open up our style CSS and let's|NA
00:03:17|00:03:23|add some of these core stylings here now|NA
00:03:20|00:03:24|I'm gonna paste these in just because I|NA
00:03:23|00:03:25|don't want to take the time to type all|NA
00:03:24|00:03:27|this out especially where it doesn't|NA
00:03:25|00:03:30|have anything to do with the actual|NA
00:03:27|00:03:33|loaders so first is the fonts I'm using|NA
00:03:30|00:03:35|the lato font as well as this z cool|NA
00:03:33|00:03:38|quality I don't really know how to say|NA
00:03:35|00:03:40|that but this will this font here is for|NA
00:03:38|00:03:43|the second loader which is the text with|NA
00:03:40|00:03:45|the ellipses that's what this font is|NA
00:03:43|00:03:49|alright and then I'm just gonna throw in|NA
00:03:45|00:03:51|a reset here so border box and then|NA
00:03:49|00:03:53|we're just taking the margin and padding|NA
00:03:51|00:03:57|off of everything and then the body|NA
00:03:53|00:03:59|where we implement the font size the|NA
00:03:57|00:04:02|line Heights the background I'm using|NA
00:03:59|00:04:04|linear gradient so we get a gradient|NA
00:04:02|00:04:06|effect and then we're setting the entire|NA
00:04:04|00:04:09|body to flex and we're using Flex|NA
00:04:06|00:04:12|Direction column so that they stack on|NA
00:04:09|00:04:13|top instead of in a row and then we're|NA
00:04:12|00:04:16|just aligning everything to the center|NA
00:04:13|00:04:18|both horizontally and vertically and|NA
00:04:16|00:04:21|we're taking up the entire height of the|NA
00:04:18|00:04:23|browser of the window our viewport I|NA
00:04:21|00:04:25|should say all right so let's save that|NA
00:04:23|00:04:28|you can see the the gradient very|NA
00:04:25|00:04:30|lightly very light gradient and then|NA
00:04:28|00:04:33|we're gonna now jump into loader one CSS|NA
00:04:30|00:04:35|and get started with the first loader|NA
00:04:33|00:04:37|now I'm gonna write this in a way that I|NA
00:04:35|00:04:40|can explain it best rather than just|NA
00:04:37|00:04:43|doing it linear so let's start off with|NA
00:04:40|00:04:44|our loader which is the wrapper remember|NA
00:04:43|00:04:46|we have loader and then we have to|NA
00:04:44|00:04:50|circle divs so the height of the entire|NA
00:04:46|00:04:53|thing is going to be 50 pixels all right|NA
00:04:50|00:04:58|and then we remember we have our circles|NA
00:04:53|00:05:00|and we're gonna set the background color|NA
00:04:58|00:05:02|to purple or you could use whatever you|NA
00:05:00|00:05:08|would like and then I'm gonna set a|NA
00:05:02|00:05:11|height of 40 pixels and a width also of|NA
00:05:08|00:05:13|40 pixels and if I save that we just get|NA
00:05:11|00:05:14|two purple squares which obviously isn't|NA
00:05:13|00:05:18|what we want let's turn them into|NA
00:05:14|00:05:21|circles by adding a border radius of 50|NA
00:05:18|00:05:23|percent okay now I want the second|NA
00:05:21|00:05:25|circle to be a different color so I'm|NA
00:05:23|00:05:27|gonna just go ahead and say circle and|NA
00:05:25|00:05:29|I'm gonna use the pseudo select select|NA
00:05:27|00:05:32|our end child and let's pass in two we|NA
00:05:29|00:05:37|want the second one and we're gonna set|NA
00:05:32|00:05:42|the background color and we're gonna set|NA
00:05:37|00:05:45|that to pale violet red and save and now|NA
00:05:42|00:05:47|we have two different color circles so|NA
00:05:45|00:05:48|as far as the animation there's two|NA
00:05:47|00:05:51|separate animations one is going to be|NA
00:05:48|00:05:53|the rotation of the loader itself and|NA
00:05:51|00:05:56|then the circles are gonna scale|NA
00:05:53|00:05:58|basically go up and down in size so|NA
00:05:56|00:06:01|let's start with the first rotation our|NA
00:05:58|00:06:03|first animation so we'll say animation|NA
00:06:01|00:06:06|rotate and we're just calling it rotate|NA
00:06:03|00:06:08|here three seconds long it's going to be|NA
00:06:06|00:06:12|in a linear fashion and infinite because|NA
00:06:08|00:06:14|we wanted to keep going now down here|NA
00:06:12|00:06:20|we're going to create our keyframe for|NA
00:06:14|00:06:24|that animation so keyframes rotates and|NA
00:06:20|00:06:27|let's say two and we want it to rotate|NA
00:06:24|00:06:30|360 degrees so we're gonna use transform|NA
00:06:27|00:06:31|here use the transform property and then|NA
00:06:30|00:06:36|rotate|NA
00:06:31|00:06:38|and let's say 360 deg okay so I save|NA
00:06:36|00:06:41|that it's gonna start to rotate now I|NA
00:06:38|00:06:43|want to have a different effect as far|NA
00:06:41|00:06:45|as the transform origin as far as like|NA
00:06:43|00:06:46|the position so I'm gonna add up here|NA
00:06:45|00:06:52|and loader|NA
00:06:46|00:06:56|transform - origin and let's say bottom|NA
00:06:52|00:07:00|center and save so now it rotates in a|NA
00:06:56|00:07:02|different way now the rotate is is just|NA
00:07:00|00:07:05|one of the animations so the circle is|NA
00:07:02|00:07:09|also going to have inanimate little and|NA
00:07:05|00:07:13|animation and we're gonna call this grow|NA
00:07:09|00:07:19|and it's going to be 1.5 seconds for the|NA
00:07:13|00:07:21|duration linear and infinite okay so|NA
00:07:19|00:07:26|let's go down here and let's create the|NA
00:07:21|00:07:33|keyframe for that so grow and we want to|NA
00:07:26|00:07:35|say it at 50% we want to transform and|NA
00:07:33|00:07:37|we're gonna use scale here scale just|NA
00:07:35|00:07:41|brings it up and down in size and we're|NA
00:07:37|00:07:44|gonna do scale one now this isn't going|NA
00:07:41|00:07:47|to do anything if I save it because it's|NA
00:07:44|00:07:49|scaled at 1 by default so it's not|NA
00:07:47|00:07:51|actually doing anything so what we'll do|NA
00:07:49|00:07:56|is we'll set the default scale of circle|NA
00:07:51|00:07:58|up here let's say transform scale and|NA
00:07:56|00:08:02|we'll set it to 0 which is basically|NA
00:07:58|00:08:09|invisible so we'll save that whoops I|NA
00:08:02|00:08:13|forgot transform scale wait a minute oh|NA
00:08:09|00:08:13|I spelled transform huh|NA
00:08:14|00:08:20|same thing goes though it wouldn't work|NA
00:08:16|00:08:22|until I set the initial scale to zero so|NA
00:08:20|00:08:25|now it starts at zero and then every 1.5|NA
00:08:22|00:08:28|seconds it scales to basically full-size|NA
00:08:25|00:08:30|normal size all right now there's a|NA
00:08:28|00:08:35|couple things we want to do in terms of|NA
00:08:30|00:08:40|the placement I'm gonna add a margin to|NA
00:08:35|00:08:41|circle of negative 10 pixels okay you|NA
00:08:40|00:08:44|can see it kind of brought them closer|NA
00:08:41|00:08:46|and I'm gonna add a delay because right|NA
00:08:44|00:08:48|now they're the growing and shrinking at|NA
00:08:46|00:08:51|the same time which I don't want so the|NA
00:08:48|00:08:57|second circle I'm gonna add an animation|NA
00:08:51|00:09:01|delay and I'm gonna add I'm gonna say|NA
00:08:57|00:09:04|0.75 seconds so now save and now you can|NA
00:09:01|00:09:07|see that there's a delay alright and now|NA
00:09:04|00:09:09|they're no longer touching so that that|NA
00:09:07|00:09:12|looks good so that's that's pretty much|NA
00:09:09|00:09:14|it as far as the animation one more|NA
00:09:12|00:09:20|thing that I wanted to do is display|NA
00:09:14|00:09:23|this as an inline inline block like that|NA
00:09:20|00:09:27|because then it goes all the way around|NA
00:09:23|00:09:32|like that okay so that's our first|NA
00:09:27|00:09:34|animation our first CSS loader so let's|NA
00:09:32|00:09:37|jump to the second one so what I'll do|NA
00:09:34|00:09:40|is in index.html I'm gonna just comment|NA
00:09:37|00:09:42|out actually first I'll copy this down|NA
00:09:40|00:09:45|and then comment this out and we want to|NA
00:09:42|00:09:49|load loader too and let's just put a|NA
00:09:45|00:09:53|comment here that says loader 1 and then|NA
00:09:49|00:09:55|I'm gonna just comment this out alright|NA
00:09:53|00:09:59|so basically starting from scratch and|NA
00:09:55|00:10:02|then we're gonna say loader 2 now loader|NA
00:09:59|00:10:05|2 for the HTML is pretty simple we're|NA
00:10:02|00:10:07|just gonna have another class of loader|NA
00:10:05|00:10:09|and then we're just going to have the|NA
00:10:07|00:10:11|text loading and you can put any text|NA
00:10:09|00:10:13|you want I'm just using the text loading|NA
00:10:11|00:10:16|so let's save that and we just see|NA
00:10:13|00:10:22|loading so let's open up our loader to|NA
00:10:16|00:10:25|CSS and let's add the class of loader|NA
00:10:22|00:10:31|and I'm gonna like I said use the font|NA
00:10:25|00:10:39|that font family what is it Z cool Z|NA
00:10:31|00:10:44|cool and then it's K you a I capital L|NA
00:10:39|00:10:45|II just weird and it's cursive okay so|NA
00:10:44|00:10:47|that's the font family that we're going|NA
00:10:45|00:10:52|to use I'm going to up the size a little|NA
00:10:47|00:10:54|bit so font size let's do 40 pixels and|NA
00:10:52|00:11:00|for the color I'm going to use that same|NA
00:10:54|00:11:05|pale violet red okay so we get loading|NA
00:11:00|00:11:07|now I want to add we're adding content|NA
00:11:05|00:11:09|here we're gonna add the ellipses or|NA
00:11:07|00:11:12|those those three dots right so we're|NA
00:11:09|00:11:16|gonna use the pseudo selector after so|NA
00:11:12|00:11:19|let's say dot loader double colon and|NA
00:11:16|00:11:23|then after which allows us to basically|NA
00:11:19|00:11:28|insert content vs CSS now for the|NA
00:11:23|00:11:30|content we can use an ASCII code for the|NA
00:11:28|00:11:36|ellipses character and that's going to|NA
00:11:30|00:11:38|be / - OH - six okay so if I save that|NA
00:11:36|00:11:40|it's gonna actually give us those three|NA
00:11:38|00:11:43|ellipses now and obviously they're not|NA
00:11:40|00:11:45|animating it just puts them there now|NA
00:11:43|00:11:47|I'm gonna set the actually I'll do the|NA
00:11:45|00:11:54|with last but I'm gonna do a|NA
00:11:47|00:11:59|display:inline-block and then I'm going|NA
00:11:54|00:12:00|to add an overflow of hidden or else|NA
00:11:59|00:12:02|it's not gonna it's gonna basically just|NA
00:12:00|00:12:05|keep its gonna show us the three at all|NA
00:12:02|00:12:07|times so we want to do that now see how|NA
00:12:05|00:12:10|they moved up we're gonna add a vertical|NA
00:12:07|00:12:13|align property and set it to the bottom|NA
00:12:10|00:12:16|so that will move it down it's actually|NA
00:12:13|00:12:18|in the middle but that's fine and then|NA
00:12:16|00:12:19|it's it's just the font if this was a|NA
00:12:18|00:12:22|different font|NA
00:12:19|00:12:24|I believe let me just get rid of that|NA
00:12:22|00:12:27|yeah so it'll be at the bottom it's just|NA
00:12:24|00:12:31|this font where it's doing that and then|NA
00:12:27|00:12:36|for the animation we're gonna call this|NA
00:12:31|00:12:40|dots and we want basically four steps|NA
00:12:36|00:12:44|so we're gonna say steps and then pass|NA
00:12:40|00:12:46|in four and then end and we want this to|NA
00:12:44|00:12:48|last two seconds and we want it to keep|NA
00:12:46|00:12:52|going so wanted to be infinite and then|NA
00:12:48|00:12:58|all I'm gonna do here in the keyframe of|NA
00:12:52|00:13:01|dots is change the width now the width|NA
00:12:58|00:13:03|I'm gonna set to zero by default so|NA
00:13:01|00:13:05|width is going to be zero pixels and|NA
00:13:03|00:13:05|save and you'll see that now they're|NA
00:13:05|00:13:08|gone|NA
00:13:05|00:13:10|so in our animation here and our|NA
00:13:08|00:13:19|keyframe all we're gonna do is set the|NA
00:13:10|00:13:22|width to 1.25 m and I think yeah that|NA
00:13:19|00:13:25|should be good so let's save that and|NA
00:13:22|00:13:30|there we go so we just get each dot|NA
00:13:25|00:13:31|showing through each iteration and the|NA
00:13:30|00:13:34|reason for that is we're increasing the|NA
00:13:31|00:13:38|width so if I change this to like I|NA
00:13:34|00:13:41|don't know 3 0.25 m you can see that|NA
00:13:38|00:13:44|it's much wider so it shows all three|NA
00:13:41|00:13:46|dots within the first animation or the|NA
00:13:44|00:13:50|first iteration so we want to keep that|NA
00:13:46|00:13:53|around 1.25 m if you want to use pixels|NA
00:13:50|00:13:58|you could do like 45 pixels I believe|NA
00:13:53|00:14:02|yeah that's fine all right and basically|NA
00:13:58|00:14:04|M units it's just relative to the parent|NA
00:14:02|00:14:09|font size we have a size of 40 pixels|NA
00:14:04|00:14:11|here so 1.25 is gonna be 40 times 1.25|NA
00:14:09|00:14:14|okay but if you want to use pixels you|NA
00:14:11|00:14:16|can so this is a pretty easy one pretty|NA
00:14:14|00:14:19|simple so now we're going to move on to|NA
00:14:16|00:14:23|the third one I'm gonna go ahead and|NA
00:14:19|00:14:26|copy that down and comment that out and|NA
00:14:23|00:14:31|let's do loader three and then let's|NA
00:14:26|00:14:36|comment out the HTML here okay and then|NA
00:14:31|00:14:39|put a comment will say loader three now|NA
00:14:36|00:14:43|the HTML for load of three is gonna be|NA
00:14:39|00:14:45|another class of loader and inside here|NA
00:14:43|00:14:48|we're gonna have three spans just three|NA
00:14:45|00:14:50|empty spans like that okay that's all we|NA
00:14:48|00:14:53|need for the HTML so let's save that|NA
00:14:50|00:14:56|and let's going to loader 3 CSS and|NA
00:14:53|00:15:00|remember this is like the the bouncing|NA
00:14:56|00:15:05|dots so we have a class of loader and|NA
00:15:00|00:15:07|we're gonna display flex basically each|NA
00:15:05|00:15:10|span is going to represent one of the|NA
00:15:07|00:15:12|dots and we want them to be displayed in|NA
00:15:10|00:15:14|a row going across so we're gonna|NA
00:15:12|00:15:17|display them as flex and then let's|NA
00:15:14|00:15:23|justify the content to the center and|NA
00:15:17|00:15:27|let's align the items to the center okay|NA
00:15:23|00:15:30|now let's take the first dot which we|NA
00:15:27|00:15:32|can get with loader I'm sorry not the|NA
00:15:30|00:15:35|first dot all of them because we're just|NA
00:15:32|00:15:37|gonna say all the spans but I do want to|NA
00:15:35|00:15:40|be able to target the second and third|NA
00:15:37|00:15:47|so we'll use enth child again so we'll|NA
00:15:40|00:15:52|say loader span and let's say and child|NA
00:15:47|00:15:54|2 and let's copy that down and we will|NA
00:15:52|00:16:01|also want to be able to get the third|NA
00:15:54|00:16:09|one alright so for all the spans here|NA
00:16:01|00:16:12|let's do a display inline - block I want|NA
00:16:09|00:16:17|to be able to add a width and height the|NA
00:16:12|00:16:22|background let's do the background color|NA
00:16:17|00:16:26|I'll do purple now for the width and the|NA
00:16:22|00:16:28|height we're gonna want to start at just|NA
00:16:26|00:16:31|zero because we remember what we're|NA
00:16:28|00:16:34|doing here is changing the size we could|NA
00:16:31|00:16:38|use scale but I'm gonna just show you a|NA
00:16:34|00:16:40|different way using with oh I'm sorry|NA
00:16:38|00:16:42|width and height it's gonna start at 0|NA
00:16:40|00:16:44|and then it's going to grow with the|NA
00:16:42|00:16:45|animation but if I set it at 0 now we|NA
00:16:44|00:16:49|won't be able to see them so I'm just|NA
00:16:45|00:16:51|gonna set it to 16 pixels height and|NA
00:16:49|00:16:54|width for now just so we can actually|NA
00:16:51|00:16:57|see what we're doing so we have three|NA
00:16:54|00:17:02|squares which are all purple let's make|NA
00:16:57|00:17:04|them into circles so border radius 50%|NA
00:17:02|00:17:07|so now we have three circle|NA
00:17:04|00:17:09|let's add some margin on the left and|NA
00:17:07|00:17:12|right so we'll say zero and then let's|NA
00:17:09|00:17:17|do eight pixels separate them out a|NA
00:17:12|00:17:20|little bit and let's go to the second|NA
00:17:17|00:17:26|one and I'm going to change the|NA
00:17:20|00:17:32|background color to pale what is it pale|NA
00:17:26|00:17:34|violet red and the third one actually|NA
00:17:32|00:17:36|the third one we'll just keep purple but|NA
00:17:34|00:17:38|we do need we're gonna have to you put a|NA
00:17:36|00:17:41|delay in both of these so we're gonna|NA
00:17:38|00:17:44|leave this anyway for now all right so|NA
00:17:41|00:17:49|now we have our three dots now for the|NA
00:17:44|00:17:53|animation let's go on to the span here|NA
00:17:49|00:17:57|and let's say animation and we'll call|NA
00:17:53|00:18:02|this bounce do it 0.6 second duration|NA
00:17:57|00:18:04|infinite and alternate now alternate is|NA
00:18:02|00:18:07|the direction the animation direction|NA
00:18:04|00:18:09|property and and what what alternate|NA
00:18:07|00:18:12|does is it makes it go forwards and then|NA
00:18:09|00:18:16|backwards so it just kind of changes the|NA
00:18:12|00:18:19|the direction of the animation so let's|NA
00:18:16|00:18:30|add this down here so we'll say|NA
00:18:19|00:18:32|keyframes bounce and let's say 2 now the|NA
00:18:30|00:18:34|width we're gonna it like I said it's|NA
00:18:32|00:18:36|gonna start at 0 pixels and then we're|NA
00:18:34|00:18:39|gonna set the height and the width 216|NA
00:18:36|00:18:42|pixels during the animation or at the|NA
00:18:39|00:18:45|end of the animation and then we want to|NA
00:18:42|00:18:54|move them so we're gonna do a transform|NA
00:18:45|00:19:00|and let's use translate 3d oops 3d and|NA
00:18:54|00:19:02|this takes in I think it's X no Y X Z I|NA
00:19:00|00:19:05|believe so we're gonna do 0 and then|NA
00:19:02|00:19:10|negative 16 which is just gonna move the|NA
00:19:05|00:19:12|dot a little bit and then 0 and the|NA
00:19:10|00:19:15|initial translate 3d let's just copy|NA
00:19:12|00:19:19|this and go to|NA
00:19:15|00:19:22|our span here and just set this to zero|NA
00:19:19|00:19:25|by default all right so let's save that|NA
00:19:22|00:19:29|so now you can see that we're getting|NA
00:19:25|00:19:30|that bounce animation basically it's|NA
00:19:29|00:19:34|just changing it it's on the y-axis|NA
00:19:30|00:19:36|actually this is X Y Z so it's changing|NA
00:19:34|00:19:39|it negative 16 which means it's bringing|NA
00:19:36|00:19:41|it up for the animation now we don't|NA
00:19:39|00:19:43|want them all going at the same rate|NA
00:19:41|00:19:45|right that looks kind of weird I mean I|NA
00:19:43|00:19:47|guess you could keep it like that but|NA
00:19:45|00:19:50|what I'll do is add a delay for the|NA
00:19:47|00:19:56|second and third so let's say animation|NA
00:19:50|00:20:00|- delay and we'll do a 0.2 second delay|NA
00:19:56|00:20:03|and then for the third one just copy|NA
00:20:00|00:20:07|that we're gonna do a 0.4 second delay|NA
00:20:03|00:20:08|so let's save it and now we get that|NA
00:20:07|00:20:12|bouncing effect and they're not all|NA
00:20:08|00:20:13|bouncing at the same exact time now as|NA
00:20:12|00:20:15|for the width and the height let's go|NA
00:20:13|00:20:21|and set the original width and height to|NA
00:20:15|00:20:22|zero and save and now we get that effect|NA
00:20:21|00:20:25|because what's happening is it's|NA
00:20:22|00:20:27|starting at zero and then the animation|NA
00:20:25|00:20:30|animation is growing the width and the|NA
00:20:27|00:20:33|height to 16 pixels per iteration and|NA
00:20:30|00:20:37|also again moving it up using translate|NA
00:20:33|00:20:39|3d alright so those are the three|NA
00:20:37|00:20:42|loaders that's I mean that's it for that|NA
00:20:39|00:20:44|part of this video now I want to make it|NA
00:20:42|00:20:46|so that we can give it the effect where|NA
00:20:44|00:20:49|the loader shows and then it loads in|NA
00:20:46|00:20:51|some content so I'm gonna go to my|NA
00:20:49|00:20:54|index.html and just for now I'm gonna|NA
00:20:51|00:20:56|comment out all the loaders and let's|NA
00:20:54|00:21:00|add our content will actually comment|NA
00:20:56|00:21:03|this out as well as comment that out and|NA
00:21:00|00:21:05|then down here we're gonna add our|NA
00:21:03|00:21:08|content which isn't much it's we're just|NA
00:21:05|00:21:11|going to have a section a section with|NA
00:21:08|00:21:16|the class of main and let's put an h1|NA
00:21:11|00:21:20|and we'll say welcome to my site|NA
00:21:16|00:21:25|paragraph I'm gonna do lorem I think I|NA
00:21:20|00:21:27|did lorem 10 or maybe lorem 20|NA
00:21:25|00:21:31|and then under that we're gonna have an|NA
00:21:27|00:21:32|a tag with the class of BTN which isn't|NA
00:21:31|00:21:37|gonna go anywhere|NA
00:21:32|00:21:39|and we'll just say read more okay and|NA
00:21:37|00:21:42|then let's include our javascript file|NA
00:21:39|00:21:46|while we're at it so script source it's|NA
00:21:42|00:21:49|gonna be J s main dot J s okay so now|NA
00:21:46|00:21:52|let's add some some styling for this|NA
00:21:49|00:21:54|we're gonna go into style.css and i'm|NA
00:21:52|00:21:55|just gonna paste this stuff in because|NA
00:21:54|00:21:57|again it doesn't have anything to do|NA
00:21:55|00:22:01|with the loaders themselves well you can|NA
00:21:57|00:22:02|just copy this so our main class let's|NA
00:22:01|00:22:05|go ahead and save that|NA
00:22:02|00:22:07|well actually we want to we don't want|NA
00:22:05|00:22:10|to do this just yet so we have a|NA
00:22:07|00:22:13|text-align:center width is 90% I'm|NA
00:22:10|00:22:16|putting a transition because what what's|NA
00:22:13|00:22:18|gonna happen is in the JavaScript we're|NA
00:22:16|00:22:20|gonna we're gonna originally set the|NA
00:22:18|00:22:22|opacity to zero and display:none but|NA
00:22:20|00:22:24|then the JavaScript we're gonna change|NA
00:22:22|00:22:27|that after a certain amount of time|NA
00:22:24|00:22:29|after the loader is done and I wanted to|NA
00:22:27|00:22:32|smoothly fade in so I'm adding a|NA
00:22:29|00:22:36|transition on the the main content here|NA
00:22:32|00:22:38|for the opacity okay so now let's do the|NA
00:22:36|00:22:42|h1 and paragraph I'm just gonna change|NA
00:22:38|00:22:44|the size of those a little bit okay|NA
00:22:42|00:22:47|and I made it smaller than I did|NA
00:22:44|00:22:51|originally just because this is so small|NA
00:22:47|00:22:53|this screen so let's also add in the|NA
00:22:51|00:22:57|button stuff and then that should be it|NA
00:22:53|00:22:58|for them the main base content here okay|NA
00:22:57|00:23:02|so now I have a nice little button|NA
00:22:58|00:23:05|alright so style.css we can go ahead and|NA
00:23:02|00:23:07|close that up and let's start off with|NA
00:23:05|00:23:10|loader one I mean it's gonna be the same|NA
00:23:07|00:23:12|thing as far as the JavaScript goes|NA
00:23:10|00:23:14|because we use the class loader for all|NA
00:23:12|00:23:16|of these it's just a matter of what we|NA
00:23:14|00:23:21|have commented out so let's use loader|NA
00:23:16|00:23:23|one okay now if I do that it's gonna|NA
00:23:21|00:23:26|show both at the same time so let's head|NA
00:23:23|00:23:29|into our JavaScript here and I'm gonna|NA
00:23:26|00:23:31|grab on to two things the loader and the|NA
00:23:29|00:23:35|main content so let's do document dot|NA
00:23:31|00:23:36|query selector and we want to grab the|NA
00:23:35|00:23:40|class|NA
00:23:36|00:23:47|loader and then we also want to grab the|NA
00:23:40|00:23:50|class of Maine and what I'm gonna do is|NA
00:23:47|00:23:52|just have a function called a knit and|NA
00:23:50|00:23:53|then I'm gonna run that function there's|NA
00:23:52|00:23:55|a million ways you could do this|NA
00:23:53|00:23:59|I just this I'm just doing this really|NA
00:23:55|00:24:00|quick so let's do a set timeout and if|NA
00:23:59|00:24:02|you're not familiar with set timeout it|NA
00:24:00|00:24:04|takes in a function so we'll put in an|NA
00:24:02|00:24:07|arrow function and then it takes a|NA
00:24:04|00:24:10|second parameter of the number of|NA
00:24:07|00:24:13|seconds or milliseconds that you want to|NA
00:24:10|00:24:15|wait to fire off whatever you put inside|NA
00:24:13|00:24:17|of it and we're gonna say 4,000 which is|NA
00:24:15|00:24:20|4 seconds and of course you could put|NA
00:24:17|00:24:23|whatever you want now in the set timeout|NA
00:24:20|00:24:26|actually I'm gonna go back to the CSS|NA
00:24:23|00:24:29|for a minute the stat main style CSS and|NA
00:24:26|00:24:31|I'm gonna uncomment this because we|NA
00:24:29|00:24:34|don't want to show the content at first|NA
00:24:31|00:24:36|we're gonna set opacity to zero which|NA
00:24:34|00:24:38|makes it invisible and display:none|NA
00:24:36|00:24:41|actually just completely gets rid of it|NA
00:24:38|00:24:43|from the Dom so let's save and now we no|NA
00:24:41|00:24:48|longer see it okay so now in our|NA
00:24:43|00:24:54|JavaScript here we're gonna say we want|NA
00:24:48|00:25:00|the loader style dot opacity oops|NA
00:24:54|00:25:03|the hell style dot opacity to be zero so|NA
00:25:00|00:25:05|basically we want it to fade out and|NA
00:25:03|00:25:07|then we also want it to just go away|NA
00:25:05|00:25:11|completely so we're gonna set the|NA
00:25:07|00:25:15|display property with style dot display|NA
00:25:11|00:25:18|and we want to set that to none|NA
00:25:15|00:25:22|okay and then we want to bring in the|NA
00:25:18|00:25:27|the main part okay though the text so|NA
00:25:22|00:25:29|let's say main dot style dot display|NA
00:25:27|00:25:31|equals and we'll set that to block|NA
00:25:29|00:25:35|because remember it's it's it's|NA
00:25:31|00:25:40|originally set to none so if I go ahead|NA
00:25:35|00:25:43|and I save this let's wait for seconds|NA
00:25:40|00:25:45|okay so what's going on here is it's|NA
00:25:43|00:25:47|getting set to block meaning it's it's|NA
00:25:45|00:25:49|actually there however it's still|NA
00:25:47|00:25:52|invisible because opacity is|NA
00:25:49|00:25:54|set to zero so we need to change the|NA
00:25:52|00:25:57|opacity to 1 now I want to give it a|NA
00:25:54|00:26:01|fading effect and if I just set it to if|NA
00:25:57|00:26:04|I set opacity to 1 here actually I'll|NA
00:26:01|00:26:12|just show you so I'll say main dot style|NA
00:26:04|00:26:14|dot opacity equals 1 and we'll save and|NA
00:26:12|00:26:16|you can see it just pops in and that's|NA
00:26:14|00:26:19|fine if that's what you want that's|NA
00:26:16|00:26:20|that's absolutely fine I just want to|NA
00:26:19|00:26:24|give you the option of having it fade in|NA
00:26:20|00:26:29|so what I would do here is just do a set|NA
00:26:24|00:26:35|timeout and pass in an arrow function|NA
00:26:29|00:26:38|and let's move this about the semicolon|NA
00:26:35|00:26:41|but we'll just take that and put that|NA
00:26:38|00:26:45|right here and then let's put a time of|NA
00:26:41|00:26:46|50 milliseconds so very quickly so it|NA
00:26:45|00:26:50|gives us a little time before it brings|NA
00:26:46|00:26:53|it in and then it sets the opacity okay|NA
00:26:50|00:26:56|so we'll save that after 4 seconds it|NA
00:26:53|00:26:59|comes in okay it sets the block and then|NA
00:26:56|00:27:03|after 50 milliseconds it fades in and|NA
00:26:59|00:27:07|the reason it's fading in is because in|NA
00:27:03|00:27:10|our style CSS we have a transition right|NA
00:27:07|00:27:12|here and if you want it to fade in|NA
00:27:10|00:27:15|quicker you could change this to like 1|NA
00:27:12|00:27:18|second so if we reload it should fade in|NA
00:27:15|00:27:20|in one second rather than two like that|NA
00:27:18|00:27:22|okay and then you can mess around with|NA
00:27:20|00:27:25|it so that's pretty much it now if we|NA
00:27:22|00:27:28|want a different loader I can just go to|NA
00:27:25|00:27:34|my HTML let's comment out loader 1|NA
00:27:28|00:27:36|uncomment - same thing down here comment|NA
00:27:34|00:27:40|that let's save and there we go now we|NA
00:27:36|00:27:43|have that loader okay if we want to use|NA
00:27:40|00:27:43|3|NA
00:27:47|00:27:54|let's try that and now we have the three|NA
00:27:50|00:27:57|bouncing dots and it brings in our|NA
00:27:54|00:27:59|content alright guys so that's gonna be|NA
00:27:57|00:28:01|it hopefully you enjoyed this and|NA
00:27:59|00:28:02|hopefully it gives you some ideas I mean|NA
00:28:01|00:28:04|you don't have to use these exact|NA
00:28:02|00:28:07|loaders just you know create your own|NA
00:28:04|00:28:10|keyframes you can see how how simple it|NA
00:28:07|00:28:13|is this is not much code at all or much|NA
00:28:10|00:28:14|CSS so that's it thanks for watching if|NA
00:28:13|00:28:18|you like this please leave a like and|NA
00:28:14|00:28:18|I'll see you next time </st>|NA

00:00:02|00:00:06| Thanks to Curiosity Stream for supporting PBS Digital Studios.|NA
00:00:06|00:00:09||NA
00:00:09|00:00:14|It looks like I'm wearing really bad tanning oil.|NA
00:00:14|00:00:15|Hey, I'm Dianna.|NA
00:00:15|00:00:16|You're watching Physics Girl.|NA
00:00:16|00:00:19|Just relaxing here in the shade on this beautiful summer day.|NA
00:00:19|00:00:20|Isn't that right, Derek?|NA
00:00:20|00:00:22| Yeah, that's right.|NA
00:00:22|00:00:23| OK, but you're not even in this video yet,|NA
00:00:23|00:00:24|so you just chill.|NA
00:00:24|00:00:27|So a couple of months ago, a few guys got in touch with me|NA
00:00:27|00:00:31|and told me that they had access to a UV camera.|NA
00:00:31|00:00:33|Do you know what that is?|NA
00:00:33|00:00:33| Yes.|NA
00:00:33|00:00:35| Basically, it's a camera that allows|NA
00:00:35|00:00:38|you to see the world in ultraviolet, which|NA
00:00:38|00:00:40|meant a few things for me.|NA
00:00:40|00:00:43|It meant that I could see what this looks like in UV.|NA
00:00:43|00:00:46|I could see what your face looks like without any lotion|NA
00:00:46|00:00:48|or makeup on in UV.|NA
00:00:48|00:00:50|And I could see how sunscreen shows up|NA
00:00:50|00:00:52|on your face in ultraviolet.|NA
00:00:52|00:00:56|And so I said, yes, please do come visit me in San Diego|NA
00:00:56|00:00:58|and bring your UV camera.|NA
00:00:58|00:01:01|And so the guys from the very well-made YouTube channel,|NA
00:01:01|00:01:03|How to Make Everything, showed up at my house.|NA
00:01:03|00:01:05|And this is what we did.|NA
00:01:05|00:01:08| Yeah, on your pants.|NA
00:01:08|00:01:10|Your pants are so tigress right now.|NA
00:01:10|00:01:13| You're going to have some weird tan lines after this.|NA
00:01:13|00:01:15| I was just thinking that.|NA
00:01:15|00:01:16| This is so crazy.|NA
00:01:16|00:01:19| Oh, they're devil horns.|NA
00:01:19|00:01:22| The bigger the better, if you ask me.|NA
00:01:22|00:01:24||NA
00:01:24|00:01:26| I gotta see this.|NA
00:01:26|00:01:27| Is that showing up?|NA
00:01:27|00:01:28| Oh, yeah.|NA
00:01:28|00:01:31| Oh, yeah.|NA
00:01:31|00:01:31| Nice.|NA
00:01:31|00:01:38||NA
00:01:38|00:01:40| Yeah, that was the fun day.|NA
00:01:40|00:01:42|But I should explain why I'm here|NA
00:01:42|00:01:44|with Derek from Veritasium, who is also making|NA
00:01:44|00:01:47|a video about the world in UV.|NA
00:01:47|00:01:49| I've been making this video for like a year.|NA
00:01:49|00:01:51| And I'm here to make him finish it.|NA
00:01:51|00:01:53|But for this video, we're going to cut in a few times|NA
00:01:53|00:01:56|to discuss the sunscreen controversies.|NA
00:01:56|00:01:57| There are a lot of misconceptions|NA
00:01:57|00:01:58|about sunscreens.|NA
00:01:58|00:01:59|And we're going to clear them up.|NA
00:01:59|00:02:00| Yeah.|NA
00:02:00|00:02:01|But for now, I'm going to turn it over|NA
00:02:01|00:02:03|to Dianna in the studio.|NA
00:02:03|00:02:04| Back to you, Diana.|NA
00:02:04|00:02:05| The first thing I wanted to look into|NA
00:02:05|00:02:08|was whether different SPFs, that is,|NA
00:02:08|00:02:10|sun protection factor, which actually|NA
00:02:10|00:02:12|is supposed to indicate how strong the sunscreen is.|NA
00:02:12|00:02:15|But anyways, I wanted to see whether different SPFs|NA
00:02:15|00:02:18|of sunscreen look different under UV light.|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|And then I wanted to compare whether high SPFs, like SPF|NA
00:02:22|00:02:24|100, are more effective than just|NA
00:02:24|00:02:27|regular high SPFs, like SPF 50.|NA
00:02:27|00:02:28|Here was my thinking.|NA
00:02:28|00:02:31|With a UV camera, things that look lighter|NA
00:02:31|00:02:34|are emitting or reflecting UV light, like the wall behind us.|NA
00:02:34|00:02:36|And things that look darker, like the shirt|NA
00:02:36|00:02:39|that I'm wearing, are absorbing UV light.|NA
00:02:39|00:02:40|Which is something that I think you'd|NA
00:02:40|00:02:43|want to know when it comes to sunscreen, because UV light,|NA
00:02:43|00:02:45|ultraviolet light, of course, is part|NA
00:02:45|00:02:48|of the spectrum of light or electromagnetic waves|NA
00:02:48|00:02:49|from the sun.|NA
00:02:49|00:02:52|And UV is just on the far side of the violet|NA
00:02:52|00:02:54|part of the visible light, rainbow, which|NA
00:02:54|00:02:57|means it's a wave that has a shorter wavelength, which|NA
00:02:57|00:03:01|means it has a higher frequency than any visible light.|NA
00:03:01|00:03:05|And in the end, it can do more damage to molecules like DNA|NA
00:03:05|00:03:06|or to cells.|NA
00:03:06|00:03:09|And as we all know, it's been linked to skin cancer.|NA
00:03:09|00:03:11|So my thinking was that, if you look|NA
00:03:11|00:03:13|at your skin with sunscreen on, you should|NA
00:03:13|00:03:15|see that UV light is absorbed.|NA
00:03:15|00:03:16|So it should look darker.|NA
00:03:16|00:03:18|And yeah, like, when we put the sunscreen on,|NA
00:03:18|00:03:20|it looked like face paint.|NA
00:03:20|00:03:22|We were even able to graffiti the side of the truck|NA
00:03:22|00:03:23|with sunscreen.|NA
00:03:23|00:03:26|But of course, you can only see it with the UV camera.|NA
00:03:26|00:03:29|So my hypothesis was that the sunscreen with the highest SPF|NA
00:03:29|00:03:32|should look darker with the UV camera.|NA
00:03:32|00:03:34|And so we tested a bunch of different sunscreens|NA
00:03:34|00:03:36|with different SPFs on a grid on my arm drawn|NA
00:03:36|00:03:37|with permanent marker.|NA
00:03:37|00:03:38|Here's what we saw.|NA
00:03:38|00:03:40|You can't see anything.|NA
00:03:40|00:03:41| That looks just like a sharpie.|NA
00:03:41|00:03:43| It looks like paint.|NA
00:03:43|00:03:45|Looks like metallic black paint.|NA
00:03:45|00:03:48|Initially, we saw that yeah, the low SPF areas|NA
00:03:48|00:03:50|do look less dark.|NA
00:03:50|00:03:52|You can tell they don't seem to be absorbing|NA
00:03:52|00:03:54|as much ultraviolet light.|NA
00:03:54|00:03:56|But interestingly, there's not a ton of difference|NA
00:03:56|00:03:59|between the 30 to 110 SPFs.|NA
00:03:59|00:04:02|And I've heard this rumor that SPFs above 50,|NA
00:04:02|00:04:04|anything really high, doesn't actually|NA
00:04:04|00:04:07|do anything more than SPF 50.|NA
00:04:07|00:04:09|So I looked into the scientific literature on this.|NA
00:04:09|00:04:10|And I actually found a study that|NA
00:04:10|00:04:13|came out just this year in May 2018 that|NA
00:04:13|00:04:18|tested 199 people with SPF 50 and SPF 100 sunscreens.|NA
00:04:18|00:04:20|Over the course of about six hours of sun exposure,|NA
00:04:20|00:04:24|the subjects got more sunburnt with the SPF 50.|NA
00:04:24|00:04:26|But they do put a nice little disclaimer|NA
00:04:26|00:04:28|at the bottom of the paper that leads you to conclude|NA
00:04:28|00:04:30|that more research needs to be done on whether there|NA
00:04:30|00:04:33|are more benefits over the long term of using|NA
00:04:33|00:04:35|SPF 100 versus 50.|NA
00:04:35|00:04:35|Hey, guys.|NA
00:04:35|00:04:37|I just want to pause on this for a second.|NA
00:04:37|00:04:40|Because I still think it's weird that I had this conception that|NA
00:04:40|00:04:43|above SPF 50, you don't get any more benefits.|NA
00:04:43|00:04:45|And Derek, let me know what you think about this.|NA
00:04:45|00:04:47|But I-- I think I've figured out where|NA
00:04:47|00:04:49|that conception came from.|NA
00:04:49|00:04:53|And I think that it's from a 2011 proposed rule|NA
00:04:53|00:04:56|from the FDA, the American Federal Drug Administration--|NA
00:04:56|00:04:59|they proposed a rule that would limit the maximum allowed|NA
00:04:59|00:05:02|SPF labeling to 50 plus.|NA
00:05:02|00:05:03|Thoughts?|NA
00:05:03|00:05:04| I also don't think it's strange|NA
00:05:04|00:05:07|the conception that the high number sunscreens are all|NA
00:05:07|00:05:09|basically equivalent.|NA
00:05:09|00:05:11|When I lived in Australia, people|NA
00:05:11|00:05:14|were limited to putting only 30 plus on the sunscreen bottles.|NA
00:05:14|00:05:16|And now, they've moved that up to 50 plus.|NA
00:05:16|00:05:19|But it's still, I think, a good idea.|NA
00:05:19|00:05:22|Because as those numbers increase,|NA
00:05:22|00:05:24|you're getting diminishing returns.|NA
00:05:24|00:05:26|So what's the difference between 50 and 100?|NA
00:05:26|00:05:27|Well, it's not really that much.|NA
00:05:27|00:05:29|Because a lot of how effective they|NA
00:05:29|00:05:30|are comes down to how much you apply|NA
00:05:30|00:05:32|and how well you apply it.|NA
00:05:32|00:05:34|So I think it's just a marketing gimmick|NA
00:05:34|00:05:38|to say that this is a 75, or this is an 80, or this is a 90.|NA
00:05:38|00:05:41| So obviously, SPF and the efficacy of different sun|NA
00:05:41|00:05:44|protection factors is still an active area of research.|NA
00:05:44|00:05:47|Anyways, back to the fun day at hand.|NA
00:05:47|00:05:48|When we were looking at the sunscreens|NA
00:05:48|00:05:50|with the different SPFs, we tried a different sunscreen|NA
00:05:50|00:05:54|with SPF 25 and something weird happened.|NA
00:05:54|00:05:56|It was actually lighter.|NA
00:05:56|00:05:58|Like, really light.|NA
00:05:58|00:06:00|This means that it's not absorbing UV light.|NA
00:06:00|00:06:03|But could it still be sunscreening?|NA
00:06:03|00:06:03|Yes.|NA
00:06:03|00:06:06|If it reflects UV light, which is most likely what's|NA
00:06:06|00:06:08|happening here with this sunscreen that|NA
00:06:08|00:06:10|has zinc oxide in it, which is a substance|NA
00:06:10|00:06:14|that's known to reflect some types of UV light.|NA
00:06:14|00:06:18|So, this is where I got really confused.|NA
00:06:18|00:06:20|I started looking up some sunscreen ingredients|NA
00:06:20|00:06:22|and what they do and why some are reflective|NA
00:06:22|00:06:24|and others are absorptive.|NA
00:06:24|00:06:25|And I ended up going down the rabbit hole|NA
00:06:25|00:06:27|of sunscreen controversies.|NA
00:06:27|00:06:29|I'll get to the discussion on health|NA
00:06:29|00:06:31|effects of different sunscreen ingredients in a minute.|NA
00:06:31|00:06:34|But I did find that Hawaii recently banned some sunscreens|NA
00:06:34|00:06:35|from the state.|NA
00:06:35|00:06:37|The reason why is that ingredients|NA
00:06:37|00:06:41|oxybenzone and octinoxate were found to be contributing|NA
00:06:41|00:06:43|to coral reef bleaching, a process whereby|NA
00:06:43|00:06:47|coral polyps expel the little algae living inside of them--|NA
00:06:47|00:06:49|actually sounds like an exorcism,|NA
00:06:49|00:06:51|but it is, in fact, a bad thing.|NA
00:06:51|00:06:55|So starting in 2021, Hawaii is banning any sunscreens|NA
00:06:55|00:06:56|with those ingredients.|NA
00:06:56|00:06:59|This ban was based off of recent research.|NA
00:06:59|00:07:01|Which begs the question, are the health effects|NA
00:07:01|00:07:03|and environmental effects of sunscreen ingredients|NA
00:07:03|00:07:04|not well known?|NA
00:07:04|00:07:06|OK, I'm just going to pause here again.|NA
00:07:06|00:07:08|Because I feel like this is a good discussion for us.|NA
00:07:08|00:07:09|There is a lot to unpack here.|NA
00:07:09|00:07:13|But I want to start out with that SPF 25 sunscreen that|NA
00:07:13|00:07:14|was really reflective.|NA
00:07:14|00:07:17| There's two major ways that sunscreens can protect|NA
00:07:17|00:07:19|your skin from UV light.|NA
00:07:19|00:07:22|One of the ways is by absorbing that light|NA
00:07:22|00:07:25|and turning that energy into heat.|NA
00:07:25|00:07:27|And another way is by reflecting the light.|NA
00:07:27|00:07:30|And what you saw was clearly more reflection.|NA
00:07:30|00:07:32|Now, in the media, they're often called|NA
00:07:32|00:07:35|physical versus chemical sunscreens, which is maybe|NA
00:07:35|00:07:37|not the best designation.|NA
00:07:37|00:07:38| I don't think it's the best.|NA
00:07:38|00:07:40| Because they are all chemicals.|NA
00:07:40|00:07:42|Maybe it's a better distinction to say that the chemical|NA
00:07:42|00:07:46|sunscreens are organic, because they are organic molecules.|NA
00:07:46|00:07:47|They have these chains of carbon.|NA
00:07:47|00:07:50|And the so-called physical sunscreens|NA
00:07:50|00:07:52|are inorganic molecules, things like titanium dioxide|NA
00:07:52|00:07:53|and zinc oxide.|NA
00:07:53|00:07:55|So they do a bit more reflection.|NA
00:07:55|00:07:56|But they also do scatter the light.|NA
00:07:56|00:07:57|They absorb the light.|NA
00:07:57|00:07:59| This chemical versus physical distinction|NA
00:07:59|00:08:01|bothers me, as you know.|NA
00:08:01|00:08:04|Because I think it's used in a misleading way|NA
00:08:04|00:08:07|on a lot of health blogs and in a lot of media|NA
00:08:07|00:08:09|indicating you should avoid these chemical|NA
00:08:09|00:08:11|sunscreens because they're chemicals.|NA
00:08:11|00:08:12| You don't like it.|NA
00:08:12|00:08:13| I don't like it.|NA
00:08:13|00:08:14| Because they're all chemicals.|NA
00:08:14|00:08:14| Right.|NA
00:08:14|00:08:15| Everything's a chemical.|NA
00:08:15|00:08:16| Right.|NA
00:08:16|00:08:19| I think there is a deeper reason why people would|NA
00:08:19|00:08:22|say chemical versus physical, because chemical could|NA
00:08:22|00:08:24|describe, by virtue of its chemistry, that's how|NA
00:08:24|00:08:25|it interacts with the light.|NA
00:08:25|00:08:29|Whereas, a physical sunscreen, by virtue of its structure,|NA
00:08:29|00:08:31|is really how it interacts with the light.|NA
00:08:31|00:08:33|You're right when it comes to the marketing,|NA
00:08:33|00:08:34|people do try to use the chemical label|NA
00:08:34|00:08:36|as a negative term.|NA
00:08:36|00:08:39| And I think that it actually hides an important discussion|NA
00:08:39|00:08:42|about the potential safety issues of what|NA
00:08:42|00:08:43|they call chemical sunscreens.|NA
00:08:43|00:08:46|So we're discovering things about sunscreen ingredients|NA
00:08:46|00:08:46|all the time.|NA
00:08:46|00:08:48|For example, recent research has shown|NA
00:08:48|00:08:50|that some sunscreen ingredients--|NA
00:08:50|00:08:52|and in particular, some of the organic sunscreen ingredients--|NA
00:08:52|00:08:55|can get into the bloodstream and into breast milk|NA
00:08:55|00:08:59|through your skin, which led the FDA to recently state that this|NA
00:08:59|00:09:02|is a significant discovery that needs to be considered as we|NA
00:09:02|00:09:04|continue to evaluate the health and safety of sunscreen|NA
00:09:04|00:09:05|ingredients.|NA
00:09:05|00:09:07|In fact, the FDA just recently rejected|NA
00:09:07|00:09:09|eight new proposed sunscreen ingredients.|NA
00:09:09|00:09:11| Because they felt there wasn't enough|NA
00:09:11|00:09:14|science to show that these ingredients were safe.|NA
00:09:14|00:09:17| But my question is that, now that we know|NA
00:09:17|00:09:19|sunscreen ingredients can enter the body through the skin,|NA
00:09:19|00:09:23|should we be looking back at those 16 ingredients?|NA
00:09:23|00:09:25|Should we be looking at them through the lens|NA
00:09:25|00:09:29|of the new research and judging them with the same thoroughness|NA
00:09:29|00:09:32|that we're judging these eight new ingredients against,|NA
00:09:32|00:09:33|for example?|NA
00:09:33|00:09:36| What's surprising to me is that there is still so much|NA
00:09:36|00:09:39|to be learned about sunscreen.|NA
00:09:39|00:09:43|I think it's a little weird because on the one hand,|NA
00:09:43|00:09:46|you're saying these health blogs are saying chemicals bad.|NA
00:09:46|00:09:48|But on the other, you're saying, well,|NA
00:09:48|00:09:51|maybe chemicals are bad, because they haven't been really|NA
00:09:51|00:09:51|tested yet.|NA
00:09:51|00:09:54| That's not why people are saying that they're bad.|NA
00:09:54|00:09:56|And in fact, some of them may be perfectly fine,|NA
00:09:56|00:09:58|and they get lumped in with the ones that do have,|NA
00:09:58|00:10:00|that do cause skin allergies.|NA
00:10:00|00:10:04|Like, to say because they're chemicals is the reason,|NA
00:10:04|00:10:07|you might lose out on potentially a ton|NA
00:10:07|00:10:09|of great sunscreen ingredients that|NA
00:10:09|00:10:12|are going to be really effective for protecting|NA
00:10:12|00:10:13|the populace against skin cancer.|NA
00:10:13|00:10:17|But people have lumped them into this chemical category,|NA
00:10:17|00:10:19|which really just means organic molecule category.|NA
00:10:19|00:10:21|Maybe we're going to find ones that|NA
00:10:21|00:10:24|don't get absorbed into the bloodstream as readily.|NA
00:10:24|00:10:24|You know what I mean?|NA
00:10:24|00:10:25| Yeah.|NA
00:10:25|00:10:28| There is so much to be learned.|NA
00:10:28|00:10:30| But at the end of the day, I think, put on the sunscreen.|NA
00:10:30|00:10:32| At the end of the day, do you want skin cancer?|NA
00:10:32|00:10:35| Because it is the most common cancer in the US.|NA
00:10:35|00:10:36| You heard it from the man.|NA
00:10:36|00:10:37|Wear sunscreen, kids.|NA

00:10:55|00:10:55| Yeah.|NA
00:10:55|00:10:56| Awesome.|NA

00:00:09|00:00:13|hear a story|NA
00:00:10|00:00:15|in 1968 the city of Seoul in South Korea|NA
00:00:13|00:00:18|built a six-lane highway above the|NA
00:00:15|00:00:22|chun-yin River in an effort to improve|NA
00:00:18|00:00:24|traffic flow it worked at first but as|NA
00:00:22|00:00:27|the years passed more and more cars|NA
00:00:24|00:00:28|began to appear until finally if one|NA
00:00:27|00:00:30|looked over at the highway from their|NA
00:00:28|00:00:32|balcony all they would see what caused|NA
00:00:30|00:00:37|jammed back to back and the honking of|NA
00:00:32|00:00:39|disgruntled drivers in 2005 the mayor of|NA
00:00:37|00:00:41|Seoul initiated a project to tear down|NA
00:00:39|00:00:44|the highway and revitalize the river|NA
00:00:41|00:00:46|this was met with much controversy as if|NA
00:00:44|00:00:49|this major road was already jammed up|NA
00:00:46|00:00:51|with cars removing it would surely make|NA
00:00:49|00:00:54|traffic worse all around the city but to|NA

00:00:58|00:01:05|citizens actually decreasing hello this|NA
00:01:04|00:01:08|video is about a phenomenon called|NA
00:01:05|00:01:10|braces paradox discovered by a German|NA
00:01:08|00:01:13|mathematician dear trick of brace as he|NA
00:01:10|00:01:15|was working on modeling traffic he|NA
00:01:13|00:01:17|noticed that contrary to intuition|NA
00:01:15|00:01:19|adding an extra Road to a traffic|NA
00:01:17|00:01:22|network could actually make travel times|NA
00:01:19|00:01:25|longer he is how imagine there are two|NA
00:01:22|00:01:28|cities origin and destination two roads|NA
00:01:25|00:01:30|connect these cities upper road and a|NA
00:01:28|00:01:32|lower road there is a point halfway|NA
00:01:30|00:01:35|through each road called halfway point|NA
00:01:32|00:01:37|where the road changes slightly from the|NA
00:01:35|00:01:39|start of upper road to the halfway point|NA
00:01:37|00:01:41|of upper road the road is quite narrow|NA
00:01:39|00:01:44|and travel time depends on the number of|NA
00:01:41|00:01:46|cars on the road the exact time works|NA
00:01:44|00:01:49|out to be the number of cars divided by|NA
00:01:46|00:01:50|100 for example if there are 1000 cars|NA
00:01:49|00:01:52|on the road|NA
00:01:50|00:01:54|it'll take each car 10 minutes to get|NA
00:01:52|00:01:57|from the city of origin to the halfway|NA
00:01:54|00:02:00|point there the road changes and becomes|NA
00:01:57|00:02:02|a six-lane highway now it doesn't matter|NA
00:02:00|00:02:04|how many cars are on this highway it|NA
00:02:02|00:02:08|always takes the same amount of time|NA
00:02:04|00:02:11|45 minutes lower Road has the same setup|NA
00:02:08|00:02:14|except reversed|NA
00:02:11|00:02:15|now let's say there are 4,000 drivers|NA
00:02:14|00:02:17|who want to get from origin to|NA
00:02:15|00:02:20|destination if they all take up a road|NA
00:02:17|00:02:23|it'll take each driver 4000 divided by|NA
00:02:20|00:02:26|100 minutes which is 40 minutes plus the|NA
00:02:23|00:02:29|fixed 45 minutes of the highway making|NA
00:02:26|00:02:32|the total commute time 85 minutes this|NA
00:02:29|00:02:34|is obviously a silly strategy a rational|NA
00:02:32|00:02:36|driver has incentive to switch to lower|NA
00:02:34|00:02:39|road because that would only take them|NA
00:02:36|00:02:41|45 minutes plus one divided by 100|NA
00:02:39|00:02:45|minutes which is roughly 45 minutes a|NA
00:02:41|00:02:47|saving of 40 whole minutes other drivers|NA
00:02:45|00:02:48|on upper road would also want to change|NA
00:02:47|00:02:50|to lower road this pattern would|NA
00:02:48|00:02:53|continue until half the drivers take|NA
00:02:50|00:02:55|upper road and half take lower road with|NA
00:02:53|00:02:58|both roads taking the exact same time of|NA
00:02:55|00:03:01|65 minutes this is a natural equilibrium|NA
00:02:58|00:03:03|a driver on upper road has no incentive|NA
00:03:01|00:03:06|to switch to lower road as it will only|NA
00:03:03|00:03:08|take them longer and a driver on lower|NA
00:03:06|00:03:11|road has no incentive to switch to upper|NA
00:03:08|00:03:13|road for the same reason this situation|NA
00:03:11|00:03:14|where no one has any incentive to change|NA
00:03:13|00:03:17|their behavior is called|NA
00:03:14|00:03:20|the Nash equilibrium in game theory the|NA
00:03:17|00:03:21|key word here is equilibrium which can|NA
00:03:20|00:03:24|be thought of as another way of saying|NA
00:03:21|00:03:26|when the system is stable opposing|NA
00:03:24|00:03:28|forces are equally balanced and the|NA
00:03:26|00:03:31|system will not change unless acted upon|NA
00:03:28|00:03:33|for example this balancing stick is in|NA
00:03:31|00:03:35|equilibrium it won't falter unless|NA
00:03:33|00:03:39|there's an outside force like wind or a|NA
00:03:35|00:03:41|monkey with half the drivers split|NA
00:03:39|00:03:43|evenly between roads no one has any|NA
00:03:41|00:03:46|incentive to move so the system will|NA
00:03:43|00:03:49|continue going on this way each driver|NA
00:03:46|00:03:52|with a total travel time of 65 minutes|NA
00:03:49|00:03:54|now let's spice things up let's add a|NA
00:03:52|00:03:56|new highway connecting the halfway|NA
00:03:54|00:03:59|points of the two roads will call it|NA
00:03:56|00:04:01|brace road it's a very wide highway and|NA
00:03:59|00:04:03|it takes virtually no time at all to get|NA
00:04:01|00:04:05|from one end to the other so for|NA
00:04:03|00:04:07|simplicity we're going to say it takes|NA
00:04:05|00:04:09|zero minutes Blanche|NA
00:04:07|00:04:11|a regular upper road commuter longs for|NA
00:04:09|00:04:14|more adventure in life and decides to|NA
00:04:11|00:04:17|try out this new highway|NA
00:04:14|00:04:20|to her surprise it only takes her 2000 /|NA
00:04:17|00:04:23|100 minutes Plus 2001 / 100 minutes|NA
00:04:20|00:04:26|which is roughly 40 minutes to arrive at|NA
00:04:23|00:04:30|destination this is a saving of 25|NA
00:04:26|00:04:32|minutes from her usual route more upper|NA
00:04:30|00:04:34|road regulars catch on to Blanche's|NA
00:04:32|00:04:36|shenanigans and start to use this new|NA
00:04:34|00:04:40|route too soon the number of drivers|NA
00:04:36|00:04:42|trying this new route reaches 2500 so|NA
00:04:40|00:04:44|their travel time is 65 minutes which is|NA
00:04:42|00:04:46|now the same total time as the original|NA
00:04:44|00:04:49|other Road route they all started on|NA
00:04:46|00:04:52|meanwhile the regular lower road drivers|NA
00:04:49|00:04:54|are slowed to 85 minutes which is a 20|NA
00:04:52|00:04:56|minute increase before these pesky upper|NA
00:04:54|00:04:59|road drivers decided to invade their|NA
00:04:56|00:05:02|turf so now they have incentive to|NA
00:04:59|00:05:04|change to the new route - with everyone|NA
00:05:02|00:05:08|taking this new route it takes each|NA
00:05:04|00:05:12|driver 4,000 / 100 minutes plus another|NA
00:05:08|00:05:15|4,000 / 100 minutes 18 minutes to drive|NA
00:05:12|00:05:18|from origin to destination a 15 minute|NA
00:05:15|00:05:21|increase from their old route so why|NA
00:05:18|00:05:23|don't they change back well no one has|NA
00:05:21|00:05:24|any incentive - if people made an|NA
00:05:23|00:05:27|agreement to go back to their original|NA
00:05:24|00:05:29|routes there would always be that|NA
00:05:27|00:05:31|annoying driver who selfishly uses the|NA
00:05:29|00:05:33|new brace highway to cut down their own|NA
00:05:31|00:05:36|travel time soon other drivers will see|NA
00:05:33|00:05:39|what he's doing and feel ripped off so|NA
00:05:36|00:05:40|they'll do it - before we know it we'll|NA
00:05:39|00:05:43|be right back to where we started|NA
00:05:40|00:05:45|systems tend to move toward their|NA
00:05:43|00:05:47|natural equilibrium just try and stop|NA
00:05:45|00:05:50|hot and cold water from mixing into warm|NA
00:05:47|00:05:52|water with the introduction of the new|NA
00:05:50|00:05:55|road the system's equilibrium has|NA
00:05:52|00:05:58|changed and become less efficient|NA
00:05:55|00:06:00|this is braces paradox and when we|NA
00:05:58|00:06:03|analyze it we see that it isn't really a|NA
00:06:00|00:06:06|paradox at all but follows from one very|NA
00:06:03|00:06:08|simple fact people are selfish what's|NA
00:06:06|00:06:10|best for the individual often isn't|NA
00:06:08|00:06:12|what's best for everyone this same|NA
00:06:10|00:06:15|behavior has been seen in other parts of|NA
00:06:12|00:06:17|life - one study showed that removing|NA
00:06:15|00:06:18|the star player from a basketball team|NA
00:06:17|00:06:21|can actually improve the team's|NA
00:06:18|00:06:22|performance adding extra products to the|NA

00:06:31|00:06:35|message of this video isn't people as|NA
00:06:33|00:06:38|selfish and stop being so selfish the|NA
00:06:35|00:06:40|message is actually it's not your fault|NA
00:06:38|00:06:42|see this counterintuitive behavior isn't|NA
00:06:40|00:06:44|just caused by people's decisions it's|NA
00:06:42|00:06:47|to do with something much deeper about|NA
00:06:44|00:06:49|the nature of natural equilibrium just|NA
00:06:47|00:06:51|so we don't have to feel bad about our|NA
00:06:49|00:06:53|selfish human nature I'm going to show|NA
00:06:51|00:06:55|you how braces paradox affects even a|NA
00:06:53|00:06:58|physical nonliving system like this|NA
00:06:55|00:06:59|setup we have here where I'm pretty sure|NA
00:06:58|00:07:02|nothing is a conscious decision maker|NA
00:06:59|00:07:04|capable of being selfish here we have a|NA
00:07:02|00:07:07|water bottle filled with water which is|NA
00:07:04|00:07:09|acting as a weight it's hanging from a|NA
00:07:07|00:07:12|bar connected to two springs and two|NA
00:07:09|00:07:13|strings now the way that the springs and|NA
00:07:12|00:07:16|strings are connected is a bit hard to|NA
00:07:13|00:07:19|see and it's very important so listen|NA
00:07:16|00:07:21|carefully tied to the bar is a regular|NA
00:07:19|00:07:22|piece of string which doesn't stretch or|NA
00:07:21|00:07:25|anything fancy like that|NA
00:07:22|00:07:28|it's then tied to the lower spring which|NA
00:07:25|00:07:30|is connected to the wait another spring|NA
00:07:28|00:07:33|is also tied to the bar and then tied to|NA
00:07:30|00:07:36|the lower string which is connected to|NA
00:07:33|00:07:38|the wait to however and this part is|NA
00:07:36|00:07:43|very important the two springs are|NA
00:07:38|00:07:45|linked together you'll see that both the|NA
00:07:43|00:07:48|strings are actually slack at the moment|NA
00:07:45|00:07:50|there's no tension pulling on them this|NA
00:07:48|00:07:52|is because they're both longer than the|NA
00:07:50|00:07:54|springs right now and as the springs are|NA
00:07:52|00:07:57|linked together the strings are kind of|NA
00:07:54|00:07:59|just hanging there at the moment our|NA
00:07:57|00:08:03|spring strings set up has a total length|NA
00:07:59|00:08:07|of about 795 millimeters from the bar to|NA
00:08:03|00:08:10|the pencil now if I unlink the springs|NA
00:08:07|00:08:17|what do you think will happen will the|NA
00:08:10|00:08:20|wait a full B rise or C stay the same|NA
00:08:17|00:08:22|pause the video now and try to figure it|NA
00:08:20|00:08:26|out for yourself go back and listen to|NA
00:08:22|00:08:26|the explanation again if you have to|NA
00:08:26|00:08:36|alright let's take a look|NA
00:08:29|00:08:36|[Music]|NA
00:08:42|00:08:47|congratulations to those of you who|NA
00:08:44|00:08:49|chose be the weight rose if you didn't|NA
00:08:47|00:08:52|get it don't worry you're not alone|NA
00:08:49|00:08:55|my intuition tells me that the weight|NA
00:08:52|00:08:58|will fall the strings were slack so if|NA
00:08:55|00:09:00|we unlink the springs the string should|NA
00:08:58|00:09:04|stretch to full length making this setup|NA
00:09:00|00:09:06|longer and so lowering the weight but|NA
00:09:04|00:09:08|that's not what happened see when the|NA
00:09:06|00:09:10|springs were linked they alone were|NA
00:09:08|00:09:12|bearing the entire weight of the water|NA
00:09:10|00:09:15|bottle there was more tension pulling on|NA
00:09:12|00:09:17|them making them stretch more when|NA
00:09:15|00:09:19|they're unlinked the wave divides|NA
00:09:17|00:09:22|equally between each pair of string and|NA
00:09:19|00:09:24|spring link so now each one only bears|NA
00:09:22|00:09:26|half the weight of the bottle so even|NA
00:09:24|00:09:28|though there was a lengthening in the|NA
00:09:26|00:09:30|system here the reduced weight on the|NA
00:09:28|00:09:32|springs cause them to compress and|NA
00:09:30|00:09:34|therefore become shorter making the|NA
00:09:32|00:09:38|total effect an overall shortening of|NA
00:09:34|00:09:40|the system and the weight rising if|NA
00:09:38|00:09:42|you're into circuits you can think of|NA
00:09:40|00:09:47|the before setup as being in series and|NA
00:09:42|00:09:49|the after setup as being in parallel for|NA
00:09:47|00:09:51|clarity let's compare this setup to the|NA
00:09:49|00:09:54|traffic scenario so we can see that it|NA
00:09:51|00:09:57|is in fact braces paradox at play the|NA
00:09:54|00:09:59|length of the strings and Springs or the|NA
00:09:57|00:10:01|height of the weight can be thought of|NA
00:09:59|00:10:03|as the travel time of the cause it's the|NA
00:10:01|00:10:06|cost or the thing that we're trying to|NA
00:10:03|00:10:08|reduce the weight is analogous to the|NA
00:10:06|00:10:10|number of cars on the road it can be|NA
00:10:08|00:10:12|thought of as the load that we're trying|NA
00:10:10|00:10:15|to handle most efficiently the strings|NA
00:10:12|00:10:16|are analogous to the 45 minute highways|NA
00:10:15|00:10:19|as their length that doesn't change|NA
00:10:16|00:10:20|depending on the conditions just as the|NA
00:10:19|00:10:22|travel time on the highway didn't change|NA
00:10:20|00:10:25|depending on how many cars were on it|NA
00:10:22|00:10:27|the springs are analogous to the narrow|NA
00:10:25|00:10:29|roads as the length of them does depend|NA
00:10:27|00:10:31|on the load just as the narrow roads|NA
00:10:29|00:10:32|travel time depends on the amount of|NA
00:10:31|00:10:35|cars on them|NA
00:10:32|00:10:37|and finally the linking of the springs|NA
00:10:35|00:10:39|is analogous to the new brace highway|NA
00:10:37|00:10:41|just as the removal of the brace highway|NA
00:10:39|00:10:43|from the road network changed the|NA
00:10:41|00:10:45|equilibrium of the traffic network to a|NA
00:10:43|00:10:47|more efficient one so to the unlinking|NA
00:10:45|00:10:51|of the springs changed the equilibrium|NA
00:10:47|00:10:54|of the set up to a more efficient one|NA
00:10:51|00:10:56|this same behavior has been seen in|NA
00:10:54|00:10:58|other physical systems too like|NA
00:10:56|00:11:00|electrical circuits water pipes the|NA
00:10:58|00:11:02|internet anything to do with heat flow|NA
00:11:00|00:11:04|basically anything that can be thought|NA
00:11:02|00:11:09|of as a network can fall victim to brace|NA
00:11:04|00:11:11|this paradox so even though in some|NA
00:11:09|00:11:13|cases your selfishness makes conditions|NA
00:11:11|00:11:15|worse for everyone it's not your fault|NA
00:11:13|00:11:18|it's a fundamental phenomenon of nature|NA
00:11:15|00:11:19|and you can't be blamed for that but|NA
00:11:18|00:11:21|seriously I think it's pretty cool that|NA
00:11:19|00:11:24|equilibrium points can have such strange|NA
00:11:21|00:11:26|behavior we usually think of them as|NA
00:11:24|00:11:28|pretty boring lukewarm areas where|NA
00:11:26|00:11:30|nothing that interesting happens|NA
00:11:28|00:11:32|scientists tend to be more fascinated|NA
00:11:30|00:11:34|with behavior that happens at extremes|NA
00:11:32|00:11:36|far away from equilibrium points like|NA
00:11:34|00:11:39|hurricanes and earthquakes and galaxy|NA
00:11:36|00:11:41|formation and the creation of life so I|NA
00:11:39|00:11:43|think it's pretty fascinating that even|NA
00:11:41|00:11:45|areas we think of mundane and normal can|NA
00:11:43|00:11:48|exhibit such counterintuitive behavior|NA
00:11:45|00:11:50|it really goes to show that there's no|NA
00:11:48|00:11:52|part of science that isn't interesting|NA
00:11:50|00:11:55|fascinating as it may be in most cases|NA
00:11:52|00:11:57|bracers paradox is an annoying problem|NA
00:11:55|00:11:59|that we want to get rid of it could be|NA
00:11:57|00:12:01|costing billions of dollars per year in|NA
00:11:59|00:12:04|inefficient road networks and slow|NA
00:12:01|00:12:07|internet and low-pressure water pipes so|NA
00:12:04|00:12:09|can we do anything about it well like|NA
00:12:07|00:12:11|most things in life if you want to fix|NA
00:12:09|00:12:13|something you first need to identify it|NA
00:12:11|00:12:16|the first question we should be asking|NA
00:12:13|00:12:18|is is there a way to identify when|NA
00:12:16|00:12:20|braces paradox is slowing down a network|NA
00:12:18|00:12:22|well the thing about networks is that|NA
00:12:20|00:12:24|it's hard to change a part of a network|NA
00:12:22|00:12:26|without affecting the whole thing what's|NA
00:12:24|00:12:28|more is that it's hard to see how|NA
00:12:26|00:12:31|changing part of a network will affect|NA
00:12:28|00:12:33|the whole thing if we remove this piece|NA
00:12:31|00:12:35|of road it could improve traffic in its|NA
00:12:33|00:12:38|local region but how do we know it's not|NA
00:12:35|00:12:40|making traffic worse over here there's a|NA
00:12:38|00:12:42|common engineering folklore that a local|NA
00:12:40|00:12:43|improvement may only transfer the|NA
00:12:42|00:12:44|problem somewhere else|NA
00:12:43|00:12:46|the way the system is|NA
00:12:44|00:12:48|connected and how different parts affect|NA
00:12:46|00:12:50|each other isn't obvious and the only|NA
00:12:48|00:12:51|way we've figured out how to analyze it|NA
00:12:50|00:12:53|so far is by running computer|NA
00:12:51|00:12:55|simulations removing a road here|NA
00:12:53|00:12:57|plugging it into a computer and seeing|NA
00:12:55|00:13:00|how it affects the overall traffic then|NA
00:12:57|00:13:01|maybe removing a road here and running|NA
00:13:00|00:13:04|the simulation again to see if it's more|NA
00:13:01|00:13:07|efficient rinse and repeat the number of|NA
00:13:04|00:13:10|possible variations is given by 2 ^ the|NA
00:13:07|00:13:12|number of roads so in a small traffic|NA
00:13:10|00:13:12|network of about 10 roads this would be|NA
00:13:12|00:13:16|fine|NA
00:13:12|00:13:17|they'd be just over 1,000 variations so|NA
00:13:16|00:13:19|we could just plug them all into a|NA
00:13:17|00:13:21|computer simulation and see which one is|NA
00:13:19|00:13:23|the most efficient a pretty ordinary|NA
00:13:21|00:13:26|computer could manage this calculation|NA
00:13:23|00:13:28|pretty quickly however if we take a city|NA
00:13:26|00:13:33|with 100 roads things get complicated|NA
00:13:28|00:13:35|fast - to the 100th power is this|NA
00:13:33|00:13:38|gigantic number it would take the|NA
00:13:35|00:13:40|fastest computer in existence today 3|NA
00:13:38|00:13:42|billion years to run all the possible|NA
00:13:40|00:13:45|simulations and see which one works best|NA
00:13:42|00:13:47|in reality there are a lot more than 100|NA
00:13:45|00:13:49|roads in any major city so the only|NA
00:13:47|00:13:51|method we've figured out so far to|NA
00:13:49|00:13:55|detect bracers paradox isn't practical|NA
00:13:51|00:13:57|with today's computing power this sounds|NA
00:13:55|00:13:59|like pretty bad news but not all hope is|NA
00:13:57|00:14:02|lost most approaches to solving the|NA
00:13:59|00:14:05|paradox so far have focused on figuring|NA
00:14:02|00:14:07|out the best network structure but what|NA

00:00:03|00:00:10|<st> this video is sponsored by the great|NA
00:00:06|00:00:11|courses class I made a video a while|NA
00:00:10|00:00:14|back and called a better description of|NA
00:00:11|00:00:16|entropy because I felt that the bug|NA
00:00:14|00:00:18|standard description of entropy wasn't|NA
00:00:16|00:00:20|great and I thought I could be better it|NA
00:00:18|00:00:22|was a really fun video to make so I|NA
00:00:20|00:00:23|thought it could become a series and|NA
00:00:22|00:00:26|this is the next one a better|NA
00:00:23|00:00:27|description of resonance the Volks|NA
00:00:26|00:00:28|standard description of resonance go|NA
00:00:27|00:00:30|something like this|NA
00:00:28|00:00:33|if you ping a wineglass or pluck a|NA
00:00:30|00:00:36|guitar string then the note that you|NA
00:00:33|00:00:39|hear is the frequency that that object|NA
00:00:36|00:00:41|likes to vibrate at it's that object|NA
00:00:39|00:00:44|favorite frequency is the resonant|NA
00:00:41|00:00:46|frequency of that object mass resonance|NA
00:00:44|00:00:49|it's okay as a description but I think I|NA
00:00:46|00:00:51|can do better the best way I found to|NA
00:00:49|00:00:54|describe resonances using this thing|NA
00:00:51|00:00:56|it's called a Rubens tube it's a hollow|NA
00:00:54|00:00:58|aluminium tube at one end it's blocked|NA
00:00:56|00:01:00|off with a piece of wood at the other|NA
00:00:58|00:01:04|end it's blocked off with rubber|NA
00:01:00|00:01:06|membrane and if I tap that membrane with|NA
00:01:04|00:01:08|my finger then that will send a pulse of|NA
00:01:06|00:01:10|pressure through the tube traveling at|NA
00:01:08|00:01:13|the speed of sound when the pulse|NA
00:01:10|00:01:14|reaches this end some of it gets|NA
00:01:13|00:01:18|reflected and it travels back through|NA
00:01:14|00:01:19|the tube to here and then when the pulse|NA
00:01:18|00:01:22|gets to here some of it gets reflected|NA
00:01:19|00:01:25|and it travels back in this direction so|NA
00:01:22|00:01:27|when I tap the rubber membrane a pulse|NA
00:01:25|00:01:30|of pressure bounces backwards and|NA
00:01:27|00:01:31|forwards inside the tube getting weaker|NA
00:01:30|00:01:35|and weaker and weaker until eventually|NA
00:01:31|00:01:38|it fades away to nothing but what if I|NA
00:01:35|00:01:41|repeatedly tap without remembering so I|NA
00:01:38|00:01:44|tap the rubber the pulse passes to the|NA
00:01:41|00:01:46|tube it bounces off here it comes back|NA
00:01:44|00:01:49|to here just as it reaches this side I|NA
00:01:46|00:01:50|pass the membrane again and now the|NA
00:01:49|00:01:52|pulse is even bigger than it was before|NA
00:01:50|00:01:55|because I've added to it so now a larger|NA
00:01:52|00:01:56|pulse is traveling through the tube it|NA
00:01:55|00:01:58|bounced back gets to here just when it|NA
00:01:56|00:02:01|gets to here I tap it a third time and|NA
00:01:58|00:02:03|that of course is even bigger again and|NA
00:02:01|00:02:05|if I keep doing that if I keep tapping|NA
00:02:03|00:02:07|the rubber membrane at just the right|NA
00:02:05|00:02:10|time the pulse will get bigger and|NA
00:02:07|00:02:14|bigger and bigger and that's resonance|NA
00:02:10|00:02:18|resonance is game with timing just right|NA
00:02:14|00:02:20|getting the frequency just right so that|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|the energy you put into the system adds|NA
00:02:20|00:02:26|to the energy that's already there|NA
00:02:22|00:02:30|that's resonance so the frequency of|NA
00:02:26|00:02:33|taps that I need to learn to get that's|NA
00:02:30|00:02:35|the resonant frequency of the column of|NA
00:02:33|00:02:38|air inside this tube but it's not the|NA
00:02:35|00:02:40|only resonant frequency of the column of|NA
00:02:38|00:02:43|air there are infinitely many so for|NA
00:02:40|00:02:45|example if I tap the rubber membrane and|NA
00:02:43|00:02:47|a pulse goes into the tube and then I|NA
00:02:45|00:02:48|tap it a second time so now there are|NA
00:02:47|00:02:51|two pulses inside the tube that they|NA
00:02:48|00:02:54|cross over like this and then the third|NA
00:02:51|00:02:57|tab happens when the first tap gets back|NA
00:02:54|00:03:00|or I could tap the remote membrane twice|NA
00:02:57|00:03:02|so you know one goes in and illiberal|NA
00:03:00|00:03:05|goes in there maybe and then a third one|NA
00:03:02|00:03:08|goes in like that and then the fourth|NA
00:03:05|00:03:10|tap doesn't happen until the first one|NA
00:03:08|00:03:12|gets back but I'm still getting this|NA
00:03:10|00:03:14|timing just right so that the energy I|NA
00:03:12|00:03:16|put in adds to the energy that's already|NA
00:03:14|00:03:19|there it's just that I've waited for a|NA
00:03:16|00:03:21|couple of taps to go in first so what's|NA
00:03:19|00:03:23|that like when you've got pulses coming|NA
00:03:21|00:03:24|in from this direction and the reflected|NA
00:03:23|00:03:27|pulses coming back and they're crossing|NA
00:03:24|00:03:30|over each other it looks like this so|NA
00:03:27|00:03:33|the waves coming from both directions|NA
00:03:30|00:03:36|they cross over each other and they add|NA
00:03:33|00:03:38|together and when you add them together|NA
00:03:36|00:03:41|you get something called a standing wave|NA
00:03:38|00:03:42|where you have nodes and antinodes the|NA
00:03:41|00:03:43|nodes are the points where there's no|NA
00:03:42|00:03:46|movement and the anti nodes are the|NA
00:03:43|00:03:48|points where there's lots of movement so|NA
00:03:46|00:03:51|how fast do I need to tap this membrane|NA
00:03:48|00:03:53|to see the effect well much faster than|NA
00:03:51|00:03:55|I can tap with my finger in fact it's an|NA
00:03:53|00:03:58|audible frequency so instead of using my|NA
00:03:55|00:04:00|finger I'll attach a speaker to the end|NA
00:03:58|00:04:03|like this|NA
00:04:00|00:04:06|so if I can drive the speaker at the|NA
00:04:03|00:04:08|resonating frequency of this tube then|NA
00:04:06|00:04:10|the energy that I put into the system|NA
00:04:08|00:04:13|adds to the energy that's already there|NA
00:04:10|00:04:15|and we should hear that as an increase|NA
00:04:13|00:04:19|in the amplitude of the sound we should|NA
00:04:15|00:04:23|hear the volume go up so let's try that|NA
00:04:19|00:04:26|okay so this isn't one of the resonating|NA
00:04:23|00:04:31|frequencies of the tube if I just bump|NA
00:04:26|00:04:34|up the frequency a little bit okay the|NA
00:04:31|00:04:38|volume went up I found the resonating|NA
00:04:34|00:04:41|frequency of this tube this speaker is|NA
00:04:38|00:04:45|tapping the rubber membrane at just the|NA
00:04:41|00:04:48|right speed so that the next tap of the|NA
00:04:45|00:04:52|speaker is meeting one of the returning|NA
00:04:48|00:04:53|pulses from this end and we're adding to|NA
00:04:52|00:04:56|the energy that's stored in the system|NA
00:04:53|00:04:57|that's resonance the problem is you|NA
00:04:56|00:05:01|can't really see what's happening|NA
00:04:57|00:05:07|because it's happening inside the tube|NA
00:05:01|00:05:10|and air is invisible which is why the|NA
00:05:07|00:05:12|Rubens tube is designed to be set on|NA
00:05:10|00:05:14|fire before I say anything on fire I've|NA
00:05:12|00:05:16|actually switched out the Rubens tube|NA
00:05:14|00:05:19|the first one I showed you is when I|NA
00:05:16|00:05:21|built myself and it was awhile ago and I|NA
00:05:19|00:05:23|didn't know what I was doing and it's a|NA
00:05:21|00:05:24|little bit worse for wear so I wasn't|NA
00:05:23|00:05:26|comfortable saying that when I wear this|NA
00:05:24|00:05:28|is one that I bought the only problem|NA
00:05:26|00:05:30|with this one is that the speaker|NA
00:05:28|00:05:31|assembly is completely enclosed and I|NA
00:05:30|00:05:34|really want to show you the rubber|NA
00:05:31|00:05:36|membrane and the hole tapping thing with|NA
00:05:34|00:05:39|this one I'm comfortable setting on fire|NA
00:05:36|00:05:42|so we pump in butane through here and|NA
00:05:39|00:05:45|then we set like to it the first thing|NA
00:05:42|00:05:47|you have to do is fill the tube with|NA
00:05:45|00:05:51|butane basically you have to get past|NA
00:05:47|00:05:53|fifteen percent butane because that's a|NA
00:05:51|00:05:56|dangerous mixture it's a stoichiometric|NA
00:05:53|00:06:01|ratio and it's explosive so we just have|NA
00:05:56|00:06:03|to make sure we get I can smell|NA
00:06:01|00:06:03|percentages|NA
00:06:17|00:06:21|[Music]|NA
00:06:26|00:06:29|[Music]|NA
00:06:30|00:06:38|so hopefully you can see the results of|NA
00:06:35|00:06:43|the standing wave in the flames so these|NA
00:06:38|00:06:46|points are the nodes here and here these|NA
00:06:43|00:06:48|are the anti nodes so these points|NA
00:06:46|00:06:50|there's the nose where the flames are|NA
00:06:48|00:06:53|small those are the points where the|NA
00:06:50|00:06:55|pressure isn't very very much at that|NA
00:06:53|00:06:58|point the tall flames|NA
00:06:55|00:07:00|those are the anti nodes those are the|NA
00:06:58|00:07:03|points where the pressure is varying a|NA
00:07:00|00:07:08|lot at that point and let's see if we|NA
00:07:03|00:07:12|can find some higher ones I swept|NA
00:07:08|00:07:12|through a few then at C we go|NA
00:07:14|00:07:24|[Music]|NA
00:07:27|00:07:34|[Music]|NA
00:07:47|00:07:54|[Music]|NA
00:07:50|00:07:56|and that is the Rubens tube so what's|NA
00:07:54|00:07:58|all this got to do with the sound that|NA
00:07:56|00:08:00|something makes when you hit it or pluck|NA
00:07:58|00:08:02|it all blow over it well any scenario|NA
00:08:00|00:08:04|like that you come across needs its own|NA
00:08:02|00:08:06|explanation so let's look at one|NA
00:08:04|00:08:08|particular example let's look at wind|NA
00:08:06|00:08:10|instruments so I've got my wind|NA
00:08:08|00:08:12|instrument here it's a bottle and I've|NA
00:08:10|00:08:15|filled it with water and I can blow over|NA
00:08:12|00:08:17|the neck like this mmm when I do that I|NA
00:08:15|00:08:20|get a nice note so why does that happen|NA
00:08:17|00:08:21|and how does it relate to resonance so|NA
00:08:20|00:08:24|when you make that noise with your|NA
00:08:21|00:08:27|manners that kind of noise that's white|NA
00:08:24|00:08:30|noise and you may have heard white noise|NA
00:08:27|00:08:33|being described as a mixture of all|NA
00:08:30|00:08:35|frequencies within a range at the same|NA
00:08:33|00:08:37|time so when you get that kind of|NA
00:08:35|00:08:39|hissing whooshing sound it's a whole|NA
00:08:37|00:08:41|range of frequencies all jumbled up|NA
00:08:39|00:08:44|together so when you blow over the neck|NA
00:08:41|00:08:47|of a bottle you're driving the body of|NA
00:08:44|00:08:50|air inside at a whole range of|NA
00:08:47|00:08:53|frequencies but because of what we learn|NA
00:08:50|00:08:56|with the Rubens tube it's actually only|NA
00:08:53|00:08:59|the resonant frequencies of the body of|NA
00:08:56|00:09:00|air inside they get amplified and so|NA
00:08:59|00:09:02|those are the ones that you hear|NA
00:09:00|00:09:05|interestingly when you hear a wind|NA

00:09:05|00:09:10|resonating frequency and all the other|NA
00:09:08|00:09:12|frequencies that are being generated|NA
00:09:10|00:09:16|when you blow over the neck of a bottle|NA
00:09:12|00:09:18|like this just add to the timbre of the|NA
00:09:16|00:09:22|sound they don't change the perceived|NA
00:09:18|00:09:25|pitch of the sound so the quality|NA
00:09:22|00:09:27|changes the timbre changes depending on|NA
00:09:25|00:09:32|the balance of the resonating|NA
00:09:27|00:09:34|frequencies that are generated and it's|NA
00:09:32|00:09:36|this balance that helps us to|NA
00:09:34|00:09:39|distinguish one instrument from another|NA
00:09:36|00:09:43|the case of guitar string being plucked|NA

00:09:43|00:09:49|I'm just massive the case of a guitar|NA
00:09:47|00:09:52|string being plucked is a bit more|NA
00:09:49|00:09:55|complicated it involves things like|NA
00:09:52|00:09:57|Fourier analysis and stuff like that|NA
00:09:55|00:10:00|it's really interesting and I may cover|NA

00:01:00|00:01:04|let's get into to this experiment so the|NA
00:01:02|00:01:07|team we went with was Manchester United|NA
00:01:04|00:01:11|because look at their budget who hunt no|NA
00:01:07|00:01:12|238 million pounds to spend I mean oh my|NA
00:01:11|00:01:14|god that is insane so we already have a|NA
00:01:12|00:01:15|lot of money to start off and we're|NA
00:01:14|00:01:17|gonna need a ton of money to sign these|NA
00:01:15|00:01:20|players but what we're gonna do to get|NA
00:01:17|00:01:22|even more money is add the financial|NA
00:01:20|00:01:24|takeover to this we're just gonna try to|NA
00:01:22|00:01:26|make Manchester United even more rich|NA
00:01:24|00:01:28|than they already are here we go guys|NA
00:01:26|00:01:31|we're equipping the financial takeover|NA
00:01:28|00:01:32|redeem item that will take place in a|NA
00:01:31|00:01:34|few days and we should get that extra|NA
00:01:32|00:01:37|cash the next thing we're gonna do here|NA
00:01:34|00:01:39|is go and try to list a ton of players|NA
00:01:37|00:01:41|on United so here we go we're gonna put|NA
00:01:39|00:01:43|Paul Pogba on the transfer list Javed|NA
00:01:41|00:01:46|daheia on the transfer list Alexey|NA
00:01:43|00:01:47|Sanchez just arrived so I don't think we|NA
00:01:46|00:01:50|can sell him right away|NA
00:01:47|00:01:51|Lukaku also just arrived Marcial we|NA
00:01:50|00:01:52|could add to the transfer list and you|NA
00:01:51|00:01:54|guys get the point I'm just gonna add|NA
00:01:52|00:01:56|basically all the big name players so we|NA
00:01:54|00:01:57|can sell them I forgot to mention one of|NA
00:01:56|00:02:00|the reasons we're starting with 200|NA
00:01:57|00:02:02|million pounds is because we added the|NA
00:02:00|00:02:03|60% transfer increase at the beginning|NA
00:02:02|00:02:05|of the season one thing we've done as|NA
00:02:03|00:02:08|well is entered United in the preseason|NA
00:02:05|00:02:09|tournament because if we go on and win|NA
00:02:08|00:02:11|the preseason tournament then if we get|NA
00:02:09|00:02:12|an extra ten million to our transfer|NA
00:02:11|00:02:13|budget we really need as much money as|NA
00:02:12|00:02:15|we can|NA
00:02:13|00:02:17|because signing Messi Ronaldo and Neymar|NA
00:02:15|00:02:18|is gonna be so hard to do and look at|NA
00:02:17|00:02:20|this we get our first offer for Chris|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|Smalling we're gonna be selling every|NA
00:02:20|00:02:24|one just so we can get that cash Chris|NA
00:02:22|00:02:26|Smalling 16 mil offer from Dortmund|NA
00:02:24|00:02:28|let's go and accept that the financial|NA
00:02:26|00:02:30|takeover actually went through and I was|NA
00:02:28|00:02:32|expecting to get a little bit more we|NA
00:02:30|00:02:34|got about a hundred million pounds from|NA
00:02:32|00:02:36|the financial takeover move so now we|NA
00:02:34|00:02:38|have three hundred over three hundred|NA
00:02:36|00:02:40|million pounds I mean that is insane so|NA
00:02:38|00:02:41|we have the three players shortlisted|NA
00:02:40|00:02:43|right here and the players will be going|NA
00:02:41|00:02:46|forward during this transfer window our|NA
00:02:43|00:02:48|Messi and Ronaldo the reason we can't|NA
00:02:46|00:02:50|sign Neymar at least in this transfer|NA
00:02:48|00:02:52|window is because he just arrived to PSG|NA
00:02:50|00:02:54|so we're gonna have to wait until most|NA
00:02:52|00:02:55|likely the winter if we can't sign them|NA
00:02:54|00:02:56|during the winter|NA
00:02:55|00:02:58|we'll wait till next summer transfer|NA
00:02:56|00:03:00|window to sign up and I guess why not|NA
00:02:58|00:03:03|just go in for Ronaldo straight away|NA
00:03:00|00:03:05|let's approach to buy the Real Madrid|NA
00:03:03|00:03:08|man Oh God okay I think what we're gonna|NA
00:03:05|00:03:13|be doing here is offering either Lukaku|NA
00:03:08|00:03:16|or Sanchez if it lets us let's go to|NA
00:03:13|00:03:18|player swap here we go|NA
00:03:16|00:03:20|Ramallah Lukaku right here let's see|NA
00:03:18|00:03:22|what they say about this just swapping|NA
00:03:20|00:03:23|straight up for Ronaldo for Lukaku|NA
00:03:22|00:03:26|they're looking to bring in the left|NA
00:03:23|00:03:28|winger so I guess we offer Alexis|NA
00:03:26|00:03:29|Sanchez right let's see what they say|NA
00:03:28|00:03:31|about that I know they're gonna ask for|NA
00:03:29|00:03:33|like a hundred million as well plus|NA
00:03:31|00:03:35|Alexis Sanchez a hundred and twelve|NA
00:03:33|00:03:37|million plus Alexis let's count a real|NA
00:03:35|00:03:39|quick and propose a new transfer fee|NA
00:03:37|00:03:43|let's see if they'll just do straight up|NA
00:03:39|00:03:44|one hundred million plus Alexis Sanchez|NA
00:03:43|00:03:46|for Ronaldo they don't they're not|NA
00:03:44|00:03:48|willing to budge okay I think we just|NA
00:03:46|00:03:51|have to accept this offer let's do it a|NA
00:03:48|00:03:53|hundred million pounds plus Lukaku|NA
00:03:51|00:03:57|yes they're happy with it okay so|NA
00:03:53|00:03:58|Ronaldo might be going to Manchester|NA
00:03:57|00:04:01|United it's so crazy cuz he just went to|NA
00:03:58|00:04:02|Aventis in real life and well he might|NA

00:04:02|00:04:07|time to negotiate contracts with Ronaldo|NA
00:04:05|00:04:10|and I think we're just gonna give him|NA
00:04:07|00:04:12|exactly what he wants because we don't|NA
00:04:10|00:04:13|want to risk him not wanting to sign|NA
00:04:12|00:04:15|with a club we're offering in that|NA
00:04:13|00:04:16|crucial role right there|NA

00:00:53|00:00:56|pointers to help you guys get going now|A

00:01:09|00:01:13|know is that I'm not a recruiter|NA
00:01:10|00:01:15|okay so recruiters are often the|NA
00:01:13|00:01:16|gatekeepers into a company they're|NA
00:01:15|00:01:18|perhaps the number one audience for your|NA
00:01:16|00:01:20|resume since I'm not a recruiter|NA
00:01:18|00:01:22|I don't really know necessarily what|NA
00:01:20|00:01:24|they're looking for what their sides if|NA
00:01:22|00:01:25|the picture is but there are a number of|NA
00:01:24|00:01:27|people who view your resume I would say|NA
00:01:25|00:01:29|about three different people the first|NA
00:01:27|00:01:31|group are the recruiters after that the|NA
00:01:29|00:01:33|resume goes into the hiring manager|NA
00:01:31|00:01:34|sometimes the hiring manager has a lot|NA
00:01:33|00:01:35|of experience might take a look at your|NA
00:01:34|00:01:37|resume and decide whether to bring you|NA
00:01:35|00:01:39|on site then there's a third group the|NA
00:01:37|00:01:41|group I belong to I'm just another|NA
00:01:39|00:01:43|interviewer I'm the engineer that|NA
00:01:41|00:01:44|developer your colleague I conduct the|NA
00:01:43|00:01:45|interview everyone's looking for|NA
00:01:44|00:01:47|different things so you need to craft|NA
00:01:45|00:01:49|your resume kind of for three different|NA
00:01:47|00:01:51|audiences and you need to be able to hit|NA
00:01:49|00:01:53|all of them one key thing to note is|NA
00:01:51|00:01:55|that in tech there's so many resumes|NA
00:01:53|00:01:57|hundreds of millions of resumes actually|NA
00:01:55|00:01:59|in order to really process them people|NA
00:01:57|00:02:01|use filters so that's the number one|NA
00:01:59|00:02:02|make sure that your resume is easily|NA
00:02:01|00:02:04|searchable you're hitting those keywords|NA
00:02:02|00:02:06|a lot of people will be doing this the|NA
00:02:04|00:02:08|tech resume often has the skills and|NA
00:02:06|00:02:11|languages section that just lists a|NA
00:02:08|00:02:13|bunch of keywords like C++ Java|NA
00:02:11|00:02:16|JavaScript my sequel Python|NA
00:02:13|00:02:18|PHP objective-c swith Android iOS|NA
00:02:16|00:02:20|angular Kotlin just a whole bunch of|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|different technologies that you think a|NA
00:02:20|00:02:24|recruiter may be looking for as they're|NA
00:02:22|00:02:26|trying to filter for a candidate for|NA
00:02:24|00:02:28|specific role the section is generally|NA
00:02:26|00:02:29|prioritized from the most experienced to|NA
00:02:28|00:02:31|the least experienced and this is|NA
00:02:29|00:02:33|something that I used to include in my|NA
00:02:31|00:02:36|resume as well but we'll see in a moment|NA
00:02:33|00:02:37|why I actually decided to remove the|NA
00:02:36|00:02:39|skills and languages section from my|NA
00:02:37|00:02:43|resume and I'll tell you why in a moment|NA
00:02:39|00:02:45|the second tip is remember that less is|NA
00:02:43|00:02:47|more I strongly recommend that you keep|NA
00:02:45|00:02:49|your resume to just one page the reason|NA
00:02:47|00:02:51|is that when I'm sitting across from you|NA
00:02:49|00:02:53|interviewing I have your resume either|NA
00:02:51|00:02:55|in front of me that's one page and I'm|NA
00:02:53|00:02:57|not going to be flipping through all the|NA
00:02:55|00:02:59|time I mean sometimes I will be but it's|NA
00:02:57|00:03:01|better if there's just one page with a|NA
00:02:59|00:03:03|concise list of things that we can talk|NA
00:03:01|00:03:04|about that presents the best version of|NA
00:03:03|00:03:07|you it's just your highlights and you'll|NA
00:03:04|00:03:09|find that I think like even Steve Jobs|NA
00:03:07|00:03:11|just had a one-page resume you know like|NA
00:03:09|00:03:13|how many pages do you really need take|NA
00:03:11|00:03:15|just the best highlights and just show|NA
00:03:13|00:03:17|that be concise and cut out anything|NA
00:03:15|00:03:19|that you think doesn't really help your|NA
00:03:17|00:03:21|case many things can actually make you|NA
00:03:19|00:03:23|look worse like listing things like you|NA
00:03:21|00:03:26|got certification level two in Microsoft|NA
00:03:23|00:03:28|Excel may actually show that your lower|NA
00:03:26|00:03:29|level than what you should be at because|NA
00:03:28|00:03:32|you had to actually go through all the|NA
00:03:29|00:03:33|steps to get that certification I would|NA
00:03:32|00:03:35|say it's also okay to leave out certain|NA
00:03:33|00:03:37|positions certain projects that you feel|NA
00:03:35|00:03:39|don't really add to your case you know|NA
00:03:37|00:03:41|like if you're an uber driver it's a lot|NA
00:03:39|00:03:43|like photography everyone can take a|NA
00:03:41|00:03:45|good picture but the good photographers|NA
00:03:43|00:03:48|know which picture is good and they only|NA
00:03:45|00:03:50|show that tip number three is in my|NA
00:03:48|00:03:52|opinion the less formatting the better a|NA
00:03:50|00:03:54|lot of really good tech resumes that|NA
00:03:52|00:03:56|I've seen look very similar to my resume|NA
00:03:54|00:03:58|I'll show my resume later on and you can|NA
00:03:56|00:04:00|just copy that format but once you start|NA
00:03:58|00:04:02|getting really creative and doing a|NA
00:04:00|00:04:04|bunch of different stuff like putting|NA
00:04:02|00:04:06|your photo on there using multi-column|NA
00:04:04|00:04:08|layouts you see italics crazy fonts|NA
00:04:06|00:04:10|charts pictures you know just starts|NA
00:04:08|00:04:12|looking like amateur hour and it starts|NA
00:04:10|00:04:13|showing that maybe you're an insecure|NA
00:04:12|00:04:15|person you're trying to hide something|NA
00:04:13|00:04:18|maybe you're trying to distract me|NA
00:04:15|00:04:20|without those flashy colors people who|NA
00:04:18|00:04:22|review resumes review hundreds of|NA
00:04:20|00:04:24|millions of them per hour and they've|NA
00:04:22|00:04:26|developed a high sense of cynicism so|NA
00:04:24|00:04:27|just show the facts also I would say|NA
00:04:26|00:04:29|that a lot of these resumes gets|NA
00:04:27|00:04:32|anyway and you want your resume to be|NA
00:04:29|00:04:34|scanner friendly so for me I limit|NA
00:04:32|00:04:35|myself to just using both phones to|NA
00:04:34|00:04:38|highlight a few things that I think are|NA
00:04:35|00:04:39|worthy italics are here don't stand very|NA
00:04:38|00:04:42|well I would also recommend that you|NA
00:04:39|00:04:44|export your resume in PDF format|NA
00:04:42|00:04:47|a lot of people send me their resume in|NA
00:04:44|00:04:48|Microsoft words dot docx format and|NA
00:04:47|00:04:50|that's struggle to try to open that and|NA
00:04:48|00:04:52|right off the bat my first impression is|NA
00:04:50|00:04:54|you don't really know what you're doing|NA
00:04:52|00:04:55|you don't understand your audience you|NA
00:04:54|00:04:57|know you've delivered the format to me|NA
00:04:55|00:04:59|that is just not really widely used one|NA
00:04:57|00:05:02|easy way to do this is you go into|NA
00:04:59|00:05:05|Google Docs write your document export|NA
00:05:02|00:05:07|as PDF and that's what I do tip number|NA
00:05:05|00:05:08|four is to try to avoid exaggerating too|NA
00:05:07|00:05:09|much|NA
00:05:08|00:05:10|it is a real turnoff when I'm|NA
00:05:09|00:05:13|interviewing somebody and I can tell|NA
00:05:10|00:05:14|that they're just fronting themselves if|NA
00:05:13|00:05:16|they're doing that I'm going to try and|NA
00:05:14|00:05:18|challenge them I'm going to see if I can|NA
00:05:16|00:05:19|trick them see if I can get them in|NA
00:05:18|00:05:21|their own trap that they've set up for|NA
00:05:19|00:05:23|themselves I want to make them prove|NA
00:05:21|00:05:24|themselves show me that they're really|NA
00:05:23|00:05:26|that good it becomes very clear if|NA
00:05:24|00:05:28|they're just exaggerating they say they|NA
00:05:26|00:05:30|led some project but then when I hear|NA
00:05:28|00:05:32|them talk about it it's not quite like|NA
00:05:30|00:05:34|that you know not every role is looking|NA
00:05:32|00:05:35|for a senior lead you know if you're|NA
00:05:34|00:05:37|fresh out of the college people are|NA
00:05:35|00:05:39|expecting that they know that and the|NA
00:05:37|00:05:40|role is crafted for somebody of that|NA
00:05:39|00:05:42|caliber|NA
00:05:40|00:05:44|that's entry level and that's fine and|NA
00:05:42|00:05:46|for somebody like that it's far better|NA
00:05:44|00:05:48|to look like somebody who is just eager|NA
00:05:46|00:05:49|excited really passionate about learning|NA
00:05:48|00:05:51|they know that they don't know|NA
00:05:49|00:05:53|everything yet they're humble and|NA
00:05:51|00:05:54|they're just really ready to learn|NA
00:05:53|00:05:56|that's great that's somebody that I'm|NA
00:05:54|00:05:58|looking for and stuff somebody who's|NA
00:05:56|00:06:00|coming here trying to act like they're|NA
00:05:58|00:06:02|really smart like they're arrogant like|NA
00:06:00|00:06:04|they know more than they are and it|NA
00:06:02|00:06:05|seems kind of dissing you in' along with|NA
00:06:04|00:06:06|that though i might mention that you|NA
00:06:05|00:06:09|want to generally highlight your|NA
00:06:06|00:06:11|strengths not your weaknesses for myself|NA
00:06:09|00:06:13|for a long time my resume was not|NA
00:06:11|00:06:15|actually in chronological order|NA
00:06:13|00:06:17|I put the projects that I was most proud|NA
00:06:15|00:06:18|of the ones I wanted to talk about the|NA
00:06:17|00:06:21|most the ones that were most technically|NA
00:06:18|00:06:23|interesting at the top of my resume and|NA
00:06:21|00:06:24|I think that's fine you know it doesn't|NA
00:06:23|00:06:27|necessarily have to be in chronological|NA
00:06:24|00:06:29|order tip number five is make sure that|NA
00:06:27|00:06:31|the first two to three items on your|NA
00:06:29|00:06:33|resume are ones that you can talk about|NA
00:06:31|00:06:35|at length for me when I sit down in|NA
00:06:33|00:06:36|front of a candidate I want to talk to|NA
00:06:35|00:06:38|them a little bit and usually I only|NA
00:06:36|00:06:40|read the first say two to three items on|NA
00:06:38|00:06:41|your resume anything after that seems|NA
00:06:40|00:06:43|like old news|NA
00:06:41|00:06:45|and I might just pick the first item on|NA
00:06:43|00:06:46|the resume and ask you to tell me about|NA
00:06:45|00:06:48|it you want to make sure that it's|NA
00:06:46|00:06:51|understandable and doesn't contain too|NA
00:06:48|00:06:53|much crazy technical jargon time after|NA
00:06:51|00:06:55|time I've seen resumes and it's using so|NA
00:06:53|00:06:58|many crazy words like set up the orbits|NA
00:06:55|00:07:00|no decks engine in order to prevent|NA
00:06:58|00:07:02|thruster failure I don't even know what|NA
00:07:00|00:07:03|that means I'm the type of person who|NA
00:07:02|00:07:05|would just say well if I didn't|NA
00:07:03|00:07:06|understand it was your fault you know|NA
00:07:05|00:07:08|you weren't clear enough after it's time|NA
00:07:06|00:07:10|I'm going to try to get you to help|NA
00:07:08|00:07:12|clarify some of this technical garbage|NA
00:07:10|00:07:13|that you've put on your resume but if|NA
00:07:12|00:07:16|there's just too much of it then I just|NA
00:07:13|00:07:17|can't make any sense of it at all one|NA

00:07:26|00:07:29|not about what that product is that's|NA
00:07:28|00:07:31|really irrelevant it's about what you|NA
00:07:29|00:07:33|did and resumes contain so much fluff|NA
00:07:31|00:07:36|everyone's always trying to sort through|NA
00:07:33|00:07:39|it to try to figure out ok this project|NA

00:08:51|00:08:55|and then the short paragraph explaining|NA
00:08:53|00:08:57|what I did not the way I do it next|NA
00:08:55|00:08:59|each project at least the languages that|NA
00:08:57|00:09:01|I had used and I think that this gives a|NA
00:08:59|00:09:03|clearer picture about how well I know|NA
00:09:01|00:09:05|the languages that I'm using because if|NA
00:09:03|00:09:07|all you do is have a section that just|NA
00:09:05|00:09:11|lists the languages you know you may|NA
00:09:07|00:09:13|list that you know Java but the funny|NA
00:09:11|00:09:15|thing is everybody knows Java right the|NA
00:09:13|00:09:17|difference is how well do you know it|NA
00:09:15|00:09:19|and if you can show that you're using it|NA
00:09:17|00:09:21|extensively time after time over|NA
00:09:19|00:09:23|multiple years well then yeah that's|NA
00:09:21|00:09:25|going to show that your knowledge of|NA
00:09:23|00:09:27|Java is actually really good I|NA
00:09:25|00:09:29|personally hate reading these sections|NA
00:09:27|00:09:31|on the languages and technologies that|NA
00:09:29|00:09:34|you know because then when I meet the|NA
00:09:31|00:09:35|candidate I have to ask okay so how well|NA
00:09:34|00:09:37|do you really know this stuff and you|NA
00:09:35|00:09:40|know the answer at some point invariably|NA
00:09:37|00:09:42|comes - yeah I didn't know this one|NA
00:09:40|00:09:44|really well I just used it you know|NA
00:09:42|00:09:45|three times or something like that and|NA
00:09:44|00:09:47|you know that's fine but just doesn't|NA
00:09:45|00:09:49|paint as clear of a picture as it should|NA
00:09:47|00:09:51|be I like to list my interests and|NA
00:09:49|00:09:54|hobbies it's not really relevant but I|NA
00:09:51|00:09:56|find it sometimes helps spark a little|NA
00:09:54|00:09:58|topic of conversation just for fun and I|NA
00:09:56|00:09:59|might also recommend that you think|NA
00:09:58|00:10:01|about the cover letter that you might|NA
00:09:59|00:10:03|write when you send in the resume you|NA
00:10:01|00:10:04|usually have a chance to introduce|NA
00:10:03|00:10:07|yourself a little bit talk about|NA
00:10:04|00:10:09|something that you've done that I think|NA
00:10:07|00:10:11|helps grab attentions and helps the|NA
00:10:09|00:10:12|recruiter understand whether they should|NA
00:10:11|00:10:14|get to you immediately or not if you're|NA
00:10:12|00:10:16|able to explain why you should be|NA
00:10:14|00:10:18|prioritised why you may be a good fit|NA
00:10:16|00:10:20|for this road and definitely include|NA
00:10:18|00:10:22|that in their cover letter it doesn't|NA
00:10:20|00:10:24|really have to be formal it can be|NA
00:10:22|00:10:27|pretty casual I would say actually and|NA
00:10:24|00:10:29|then my last bonus tip is it's really|NA

00:00:54|00:00:58|you know it's a funny thing that all new|NA
00:00:56|00:01:00|engineers exhibit certain traits and|NA
00:00:58|00:01:02|just by looking at the way they act the|NA
00:01:00|00:01:04|patterns that they go about in their|NA
00:01:02|00:01:05|daily routines the code that they output|NA
00:01:04|00:01:07|you can pretty much tell who's an|NA
00:01:05|00:01:09|experienced engineer and who's new and|NA
00:01:07|00:01:11|these new engineers all go through the|NA
00:01:09|00:01:13|same things and it takes them sometimes|NA
00:01:11|00:01:16|months sometimes years to outgrow their|NA
00:01:13|00:01:18|behaviors to turn pro so to speak every|NA
00:01:16|00:01:19|new engineer has to go through this|NA
00:01:18|00:01:21|training and every single company and|NA
00:01:19|00:01:23|it's just tiresome these same lessons|NA
00:01:21|00:01:25|need to be repeated over and over again|NA
00:01:23|00:01:27|I thought I would just give you guys the|NA
00:01:25|00:01:29|basic tip such that when you get started|NA
00:01:27|00:01:30|or if you're already working then you're|NA
00:01:29|00:01:32|going to be well on your way and people|NA
00:01:30|00:01:34|aren't going to have to give to you the|NA
00:01:32|00:01:36|same lessons over and over again you|NA
00:01:34|00:01:37|know it's funny that when you start|NA
00:01:36|00:01:40|working at say a company like Google|NA
00:01:37|00:01:42|they like to haze you in your first code|NA
00:01:40|00:01:44|reviews they will leave you hundreds if|NA
00:01:42|00:01:46|not millions of comments in your first|NA
00:01:44|00:01:48|div output that you're trying to commit|NA
00:01:46|00:01:50|and people just say hey this is wrong|NA
00:01:48|00:01:52|this line of code wrong this line of|NA
00:01:50|00:01:53|code bad there would be so many pedantic|NA
00:01:52|00:01:56|comments that many people just end up|NA
00:01:53|00:01:57|quitting the next day and that's the|NA
00:01:56|00:01:59|funny thing a lot of people don't know|NA
00:01:57|00:02:01|is that of the people who get in to say|NA
00:01:59|00:02:02|Google as an engineer about half quit|NA
00:02:01|00:02:05|before they even submit their first line|NA
00:02:02|00:02:07|of code so let's get into it the first|NA
00:02:05|00:02:10|tip and this has been repeated over and|NA
00:02:07|00:02:12|over again is keep your dev sizes small|NA
00:02:10|00:02:13|keep your commit small chances are when|NA
00:02:12|00:02:15|you first start you're going to|NA
00:02:13|00:02:17|a starter project that's going to|NA
00:02:15|00:02:19|require a sizeable chunk of code to|NA
00:02:17|00:02:21|complete some feature and the key to|NA
00:02:19|00:02:22|know here is this isn't so much about|NA
00:02:21|00:02:24|completely in the future it's probably a|NA
00:02:22|00:02:26|useless feature that nobody even cares|NA
00:02:24|00:02:28|about what people really want to see you|NA
00:02:26|00:02:31|do is start learning the coding practice|NA
00:02:28|00:02:32|is the development process in which you|NA
00:02:31|00:02:34|get a code submitted and this really|NA
00:02:32|00:02:35|involves the process in which you break|NA
00:02:34|00:02:37|down the project into bite-sized chunks|NA
00:02:35|00:02:40|and you submit targeted small pieces of|NA
00:02:37|00:02:42|code one at a time instead of submitting|NA
00:02:40|00:02:44|the whole thing and chances are when you|NA
00:02:42|00:02:46|submit this whole piece of code for a|NA
00:02:44|00:02:48|code review and it's thousands of lines|NA
00:02:46|00:02:50|of code people are just going to look at|NA
00:02:48|00:02:51|it and say hey yeah this one line here|NA
00:02:50|00:02:53|this one way that you did this was|NA
00:02:51|00:02:54|entirely wrong and the whole thing needs|NA
00:02:53|00:02:56|to be redone when you get started|NA
00:02:54|00:02:57|there's a high chance you're going to|NA
00:02:56|00:02:59|fundamentally get some pattern some|NA
00:02:57|00:03:01|design or architecture of your program|NA
00:02:59|00:03:03|wrong it's going to change the whole way|NA
00:03:01|00:03:04|that the thing is going to be written so|NA
00:03:03|00:03:06|if you submit small-sized ifs|NA
00:03:04|00:03:07|incrementally people can help make sure|NA
00:03:06|00:03:09|that you're on the right track you're|NA
00:03:07|00:03:11|not wasting too much time and it also|NA
00:03:09|00:03:12|makes it easier to land your diffs|NA
00:03:11|00:03:14|because it's simply easier to get|NA
00:03:12|00:03:17|approval on small size chunks of code|NA
00:03:14|00:03:19|are very targeted instead of a whole|NA
00:03:17|00:03:21|menagerie of random divs many times I|NA
00:03:19|00:03:22|will actually write my code in an editor|NA
00:03:21|00:03:24|that shows line by line tips of what|NA
00:03:22|00:03:27|changes are making like Visual Studio|NA
00:03:24|00:03:28|code or Adam will show this and this|NA
00:03:27|00:03:30|helps ensure that you're not just|NA
00:03:28|00:03:32|changing random lines of text that don't|NA
00:03:30|00:03:33|need to be changed almost every company|NA
00:03:32|00:03:36|I go through they beat this one lesson|NA
00:03:33|00:03:38|about having small tips over and over to|NA
00:03:36|00:03:39|new engineers if you go into the company|NA
00:03:38|00:03:40|already knowing this you're going to be|NA
00:03:39|00:03:42|set|NA
00:03:40|00:03:44|now the second sign of a new and|NA
00:03:42|00:03:46|experienced developer is just crazy|NA
00:03:44|00:03:48|tangled code crazy logic all over the|NA
00:03:46|00:03:50|place huge functions tons of if|NA
00:03:48|00:03:52|statements all over the place random|NA
00:03:50|00:03:54|helper methods everywhere premature|NA
00:03:52|00:03:56|optimization over engineered garbage|NA
00:03:54|00:03:58|code and so country - what you might|NA
00:03:56|00:04:00|imagine bad code is not simply code that|NA
00:03:58|00:04:02|has a ton of bugs doesn't compile|NA
00:04:00|00:04:03|doesn't work a decent engineer will at|NA
00:04:02|00:04:06|least be able to get their code to|NA
00:04:03|00:04:09|compile to work and is even going to run|NA
00:04:06|00:04:11|and function okay but the way the logic|NA
00:04:09|00:04:12|is set up the way the code is written is|NA
00:04:11|00:04:14|going to look completely horrible it's|NA
00:04:12|00:04:17|gonna look like garbage code tangled|NA
00:04:14|00:04:18|totally messy complex stuff and it's|NA
00:04:17|00:04:20|pretty much going to be a complete pain|NA
00:04:18|00:04:22|to read many times I would just get a|NA
00:04:20|00:04:23|headache after reading some beginners|NA
00:04:22|00:04:25|code and then I have to get up and get a|NA
00:04:23|00:04:27|coffee break my recommendation here is|NA
00:04:25|00:04:29|write at design talk|NA
00:04:27|00:04:30|right a document that describes what|NA
00:04:29|00:04:32|you're going to build what the future|NA
00:04:30|00:04:34|requirements are how you're going to set|NA
00:04:32|00:04:35|things up which functions you're going|NA
00:04:34|00:04:37|to need which classes what data|NA
00:04:35|00:04:39|structures you might need and then just|NA
00:04:37|00:04:41|go build those out and that should help|NA
00:04:39|00:04:42|you organize your ideas is very obvious|NA
00:04:41|00:04:44|actually when I see code that was|NA
00:04:42|00:04:46|written without design dog because|NA
00:04:44|00:04:49|there's just repeated duplicate code|NA
00:04:46|00:04:51|logic if statements all over the place|NA
00:04:49|00:04:53|it somehow manages to work I mean the|NA
00:04:51|00:04:55|code is going to work fine but it's just|NA
00:04:53|00:04:56|going to look like pretty crazy code I'm|NA
00:04:55|00:04:58|probably going to go ahead and approve|NA
00:04:56|00:05:00|your code anyway but I know it's going|NA
00:04:58|00:05:01|to cause you a lot of hell later on as|NA
00:05:00|00:05:02|you're going to become the one|NA
00:05:01|00:05:04|maintaining this code throughout your|NA
00:05:02|00:05:06|career and it's just going to slow you|NA
00:05:04|00:05:07|down through the rest of your job over|NA
00:05:06|00:05:09|the months as you're going to have to|NA
00:05:07|00:05:10|start adding features to this code|NA
00:05:09|00:05:11|you're going to have to start reading it|NA
00:05:10|00:05:13|and there's just going to be bugs|NA
00:05:11|00:05:15|introduced every single time you tried|NA
00:05:13|00:05:16|to modify the code you're going to have|NA
00:05:15|00:05:18|to make changes in the whole bunch of|NA
00:05:16|00:05:20|different areas the logic is going to be|NA
00:05:18|00:05:22|pretty loopy right design dog save|NA
00:05:20|00:05:25|yourself sometimes gonna make you look a|NA
00:05:22|00:05:27|little bit better too the third trait of|NA
00:05:25|00:05:29|a new and experienced developer is low|NA
00:05:27|00:05:31|effectiveness now don't get me wrong|NA
00:05:29|00:05:32|everyone's working hard everyone's|NA
00:05:31|00:05:33|trying to prove themselves they know|NA
00:05:32|00:05:35|they're new they're trying to do things|NA
00:05:33|00:05:38|but they're just not effective and they|NA
00:05:35|00:05:40|end up wasting tons of time I know guy|NA
00:05:38|00:05:42|who was working on this feature for|NA
00:05:40|00:05:44|months and it was a pretty complicated|NA
00:05:42|00:05:46|UI in fact the UI was essentially|NA
00:05:44|00:05:48|impossible to do you know the UI|NA
00:05:46|00:05:49|designers just came up with it and he|NA
00:05:48|00:05:52|started trying to work on it and coming|NA
00:05:49|00:05:53|up with totally convoluted code none of|NA
00:05:52|00:05:56|it was really done well it was very|NA
00:05:53|00:05:58|hacky stuff and I think he just wasn't|NA
00:05:56|00:05:59|having his eye on the goal he was just|NA
00:05:58|00:06:02|obsessed with maybe doing a bunch of|NA
00:05:59|00:06:04|groundwork this project never launched|NA
00:06:02|00:06:06|by the way and later on I came up with a|NA
00:06:04|00:06:08|better solution for it I pushed back on|NA
00:06:06|00:06:10|the UI designers loop and said hey if we|NA
00:06:08|00:06:11|do it this way it's going to be much|NA
00:06:10|00:06:13|easier to implement it's going to look|NA
00:06:11|00:06:15|good too and so I would say don't just|NA
00:06:13|00:06:17|code for coding sake look at the forest|NA
00:06:15|00:06:18|not the trees keep your eye on the|NA
00:06:17|00:06:20|vision the goal that you're trying to|NA
00:06:18|00:06:22|make happen and make sure that your code|NA
00:06:20|00:06:23|at least ships and if you don't foresee|NA
00:06:22|00:06:25|your code ship and try to clear the|NA
00:06:23|00:06:27|roadblocks for that make sure that you|NA
00:06:25|00:06:29|can get your impact in where you can you|NA
00:06:27|00:06:31|also want to keep an eye on your APM|NA
00:06:29|00:06:33|actions per minute I don't love|NA
00:06:31|00:06:35|engineers they go in and they spend the|NA
00:06:33|00:06:37|whole day surfing reddit checking|NA
00:06:35|00:06:40|Facebook social media blogs Twitter|NA
00:06:37|00:06:40|surfing news and I look at these new|NA
00:06:40|00:06:42|engineers|NA
00:06:40|00:06:43|half the time they're watching a YouTube|NA
00:06:42|00:06:45|video of someone playing the game maybe|NA
00:06:43|00:06:47|they're the one playing the game maybe|NA
00:06:45|00:06:48|they're even broadcasting that game and|NA
00:06:47|00:06:50|that's all great people can work like|NA
00:06:48|00:06:52|that think of work on their own time if|NA
00:06:50|00:06:54|they like and I used to sort of do this|NA
00:06:52|00:06:55|- I was going to work and I would have|NA
00:06:54|00:06:57|one window maybe I'll do some online|NA
00:06:55|00:06:59|shopping whatever it is I want to do but|NA
00:06:57|00:07:00|the thing is when you play a game like|NA
00:06:59|00:07:02|Starcraft you notice that whoever has|NA
00:07:00|00:07:04|the highest APM usually wins the match|NA
00:07:02|00:07:05|in the Starcraft game not always but|NA
00:07:04|00:07:07|usually it really goes a long way so|NA
00:07:05|00:07:09|that's really the same thing for|NA
00:07:07|00:07:11|developers as well if you're spending|NA
00:07:09|00:07:13|any available time you have on the job|NA
00:07:11|00:07:15|for instance just imagine how much more|NA
00:07:13|00:07:17|productive you might be able to be you|NA
00:07:15|00:07:19|know you could get probably a lot more|NA
00:07:17|00:07:21|code submitted read a lot Co learn about|NA
00:07:19|00:07:22|the codebase come up with ideas you|NA
00:07:21|00:07:24|could get a whole bunch done and I would|NA
00:07:22|00:07:25|say that one flaw of new engineers is|NA
00:07:24|00:07:28|sometimes I'll take a look at that code|NA
00:07:25|00:07:30|output after a whole week and they may|NA
00:07:28|00:07:31|have submitted like one or two pieces of|NA
00:07:30|00:07:34|code the whole week and just a reminder|NA
00:07:31|00:07:36|how is it possible that somebody could|NA
00:07:34|00:07:38|spend five days I had a job and some a|NA
00:07:36|00:07:39|only two pieces of code or even one|NA
00:07:38|00:07:42|piece of code or none in the whole week|NA
00:07:39|00:07:43|and then I remember oh yeah that's right|NA
00:07:42|00:07:45|they were probably playing games that|NA
00:07:43|00:07:47|whole time maybe they were doing online|NA
00:07:45|00:07:49|shopping who knows and it's kind of no|NA
00:07:47|00:07:51|wonder that for a lot of these people|NA
00:07:49|00:07:53|their productivity is just very low my|NA
00:07:51|00:07:54|recommendation is tried to get at least|NA
00:07:53|00:07:56|one piece of code so made that per day|NA
00:07:54|00:07:58|that'll keep you on track make that just|NA
00:07:56|00:08:00|a personal go for yourself that'll keep|NA
00:07:58|00:08:01|you going the fourth son of an|NA
00:08:00|00:08:03|experienced engineer is they usually|NA
00:08:01|00:08:05|have a lot of pride a lot of ego a lot|NA
00:08:03|00:08:07|of arrogance and this is something that|NA
00:08:05|00:08:08|you see other lot of computer science|NA
00:08:07|00:08:10|students coming out of college for|NA
00:08:08|00:08:12|instance their arrogance is just|NA
00:08:10|00:08:14|incredible the worst is when I'm|NA
00:08:12|00:08:15|reviewing a new engineers code and I|NA
00:08:14|00:08:18|decide to leave like say a hundred|NA
00:08:15|00:08:19|comments and then the engineer comes by|NA
00:08:18|00:08:21|my desk and personally asks me about|NA
00:08:19|00:08:23|each comment and tries to justify why|NA
00:08:21|00:08:25|he's right about each one and then I|NA
00:08:23|00:08:27|have to get in a little argument about|NA
00:08:25|00:08:28|each one with him and he's trying to|NA
00:08:27|00:08:30|defend himself and laughing at other|NA
00:08:28|00:08:31|people who may be more stupid than him|NA
00:08:30|00:08:34|trying to sound cool trying to sound|NA
00:08:31|00:08:35|smart it's like look I don't care if you|NA
00:08:34|00:08:37|think you're cool I don't care if you|NA
00:08:35|00:08:38|think I think you're cool if you want me|NA
00:08:37|00:08:40|to say you're cool fine you're cool I'm|NA
00:08:38|00:08:43|cool we're all cool everybody's cool I'm|NA
00:08:40|00:08:45|just cooler than you okay so the thing|NA
00:08:43|00:08:47|about arrogance is it has a lot of other|NA
00:08:45|00:08:49|effects as well for example it causes|NA
00:08:47|00:08:51|engineers to over engineer their code to|NA
00:08:49|00:08:53|make it look really smart and clever|NA
00:08:51|00:08:54|keep it simple also I would recommend|NA
00:08:53|00:08:56|that you swallow|NA
00:08:54|00:08:57|your pride and go as for questions as|NA
00:08:56|00:08:59|for help when you need it it can save|NA
00:08:57|00:09:01|you a ton of time this kind of goes back|NA
00:08:59|00:09:03|to being ineffective love new engineers|NA
00:09:01|00:09:04|just want to tackle everything on their|NA
00:09:03|00:09:06|own they spend a lot of time doing|NA
00:09:04|00:09:07|things on their own a week or two later|NA
00:09:06|00:09:09|they surface again with a bunch of|NA
00:09:07|00:09:10|garbage code that they've written and I|NA
00:09:09|00:09:12|have to say this whole thing was wrong|NA
00:09:10|00:09:13|this whole thing was just no good I wish|NA
00:09:12|00:09:15|they would just asked an experienced|NA
00:09:13|00:09:17|developer like myself what I would've|NA
00:09:15|00:09:19|approved and that could have saved|NA
00:09:17|00:09:21|everyone a lot of time my last time|NA
00:09:19|00:09:23|final tip the sign of an inexperienced|NA
00:09:21|00:09:25|engineer is somebody who does not|NA
00:09:23|00:09:28|identify and respect the tech lead|NA
00:09:25|00:09:29|that's me make sure that you know who|NA
00:09:28|00:09:31|the tech lead is I'm not talking about|NA
00:09:29|00:09:33|your manager I'm not talking about your|NA
00:09:31|00:09:35|boss you may already have a tech lead at|NA
00:09:33|00:09:36|your company that may not be the tech|NA
00:09:35|00:09:41|lead that person could be X Microsoft|NA
00:09:36|00:09:42|for example I am X Google ok X could go|NA
00:09:41|00:09:44|tech lead you want to make sure you know|NA
00:09:42|00:09:45|who the tech lead is now I have a story|NA
00:09:44|00:09:47|for you one time there was this engineer|NA
00:09:45|00:09:49|he did not respect the tech lead he|NA
00:09:47|00:09:51|dared not to and let me just tell you|NA
00:09:49|00:09:52|what happened to him because this is|NA
00:09:51|00:09:54|going to be a good lesson for all of you|NA
00:09:52|00:09:57|he started proposing tons of random code|NA
00:09:54|00:10:00|for his project no design doc huge tips|NA
00:09:57|00:10:02|very complicated logic and I pushed back|NA
00:10:00|00:10:04|on and said yeah this isn't going to|NA
00:10:02|00:10:06|work he did not respect my comments and|NA
00:10:04|00:10:08|kept pushing forward with his code he|NA
00:10:06|00:10:10|kept proposing tons of code disappeared|NA
00:10:08|00:10:12|came back two weeks later with a bunch|NA
00:10:10|00:10:14|more additional code didn't listen to a|NA
00:10:12|00:10:16|single comment that I suggested for him|NA
00:10:14|00:10:17|and I blocked every single code that he|NA
00:10:16|00:10:19|tried to put in that's right I would|NA
00:10:17|00:10:20|block his code I would just spend all my|NA
00:10:19|00:10:22|time writing millions of comments and he|NA
00:10:20|00:10:24|would have to write millions of replies|NA
00:10:22|00:10:26|back eventually we started just writing|NA
00:10:24|00:10:28|essays on these tips we stopped coding|NA
00:10:26|00:10:30|really his effectiveness his code output|NA
00:10:28|00:10:33|dropped to zero you know what happened|NA
00:10:30|00:10:34|to him he got fired that's right so|NA
00:10:33|00:10:37|that's one lesson for you if you don't|NA
00:10:34|00:10:39|respect the tech lead I would recommend|NA
00:10:37|00:10:41|if I are you to actually be nice to the|NA
00:10:39|00:10:42|tech lead do whatever you can for him|NA
00:10:41|00:10:44|you know bring him lunch bring him tea|NA
00:10:42|00:10:46|one little trick you can do is instead|NA
00:10:44|00:10:47|of having you submit code come up with a|NA
00:10:46|00:10:49|diff|NA
00:10:47|00:10:50|mail it to the tech lead and then the|NA
00:10:49|00:10:53|tech lead to a patch your dip in and|NA
00:10:50|00:10:54|then submit that for you and that way|NA
00:10:53|00:10:55|the tech lead will get credit for the|NA
00:10:54|00:10:56|dips|NA
00:10:55|00:10:58|it just helps increase the number of|NA
00:10:56|00:11:01|dips that the tech leader is putting out|NA
00:10:58|00:11:03|what you can also do is when you write|NA
00:11:01|00:11:04|design documents but the tech Lee's name|NA
00:11:03|00:11:07|on it even if I have no part in the|NA
00:11:04|00:11:08|design dock or presentation or email or|NA
00:11:07|00:11:10|post or whatever it is that your|NA
00:11:08|00:11:12|writing just put my name there in the|NA
00:11:10|00:11:13|authors to credit this line that would|NA
00:11:12|00:11:14|be great I would appreciate that that|NA
00:11:13|00:11:16|helps me get a little bit more credit a|NA
00:11:14|00:11:19|little bit more awareness for people|NA
00:11:16|00:11:21|like me who are here to take credit for|NA
00:11:19|00:11:23|your work buying me stuff give me things|NA
00:11:21|00:11:25|give me money any of that I'll take it|NA
00:11:23|00:11:27|respect the tech lead they'll do it for|NA
00:11:25|00:11:29|me feel free to share your table signs|NA
00:11:27|00:11:31|of junior engineers in the comments|NA
00:11:29|00:11:34|below if you liked the video give a like|NA
00:11:31|00:11:34|and subscribe I'll see you next time bye </st>|NA
00:00:00|00:00:03|<st> hey tech late here welcome back to|NA
00:00:01|00:00:05|another episode of tech lead today I'll|NA
00:00:03|00:00:08|be your tech lead at the tech lead and|NA
00:00:05|00:00:10|this is coffee time with the tech lead|NA
00:00:08|00:00:12|now I thought what we will talk about|NA
00:00:10|00:00:15|today are seven common mistakes that you|NA
00:00:12|00:00:17|might make in the technical interview|NA
00:00:15|00:00:20|now I might be qualified to talk about|NA
00:00:17|00:00:21|this because I am an ex-googler engineer|NA
00:00:20|00:00:23|tech lead and I've done over 100|NA
00:00:21|00:00:25|technical interviews and I've seen them|A
00:00:23|00:00:27|on today's video by the way is brought|A
00:00:25|00:00:28|to you by brilliant org an educational|A
00:00:27|00:00:30|website where you can learn about|A
00:00:28|00:00:33|algorithms computer science fundamentals|A
00:00:30|00:00:35|math probability statistics and the|A
00:00:33|00:00:36|whole range of topics that can help you|A
00:00:35|00:00:38|increase your technical fundamentals and|A
00:00:36|00:00:40|knowledge to make sure that you pass|A
00:00:38|00:00:42|your next technical interview with|A
00:00:40|00:00:45|flying colors so that you can see that|A
00:00:42|00:00:47|light of success now there are a lot of|NA
00:00:45|00:00:49|common mistakes that newcomers and|NA
00:00:47|00:00:51|veterans alike will make when they walk|NA
00:00:49|00:00:53|into a technical interview and having|NA
00:00:51|00:00:55|done so many interviews in my past I|NA
00:00:53|00:00:57|will be able to clearly see a lot of|NA
00:00:55|00:00:59|mistakes these are common mistakes that|NA
00:00:57|00:01:01|you can easily correct and they're going|NA
00:00:59|00:01:03|to be applicable not just for technical|NA
00:01:01|00:01:05|interviews but also for any interview|NA
00:01:03|00:01:06|and any interaction in general and I|NA
00:01:05|00:01:08|think that these are going to be great|NA
00:01:06|00:01:11|philosophies upon which you may live|NA
00:01:08|00:01:13|your life and base your life on now the|NA
00:01:11|00:01:16|technical interview generally consists|NA
00:01:13|00:01:18|of five to six short 45-minute sessions|NA
00:01:16|00:01:19|and these are sessions in which you have|NA
00:01:18|00:01:22|to prove yourself you only have one|NA
00:01:19|00:01:24|chance per session to show why you're|NA
00:01:22|00:01:27|the person who's qualified and if any|NA
00:01:24|00:01:30|one of these people give you a low mark|NA
00:01:27|00:01:32|a low score then your chances are going|NA
00:01:30|00:01:33|to be really up against you because a|NA
00:01:32|00:01:36|lot of these companies believe in the|NA
00:01:33|00:01:38|idea of not hiring false positives they|NA
00:01:36|00:01:40|were biased towards not giving you the|NA
00:01:38|00:01:42|benefit of the doubt if they don't know|NA
00:01:40|00:01:44|if the signals not clear then it's just|NA
00:01:42|00:01:45|going to be a pass because there's going|NA
00:01:44|00:01:47|to be enough people who can give a|NA
00:01:45|00:01:49|strong higher signal and if they|NA
00:01:47|00:01:51|accidentally make a bad hire is really|NA
00:01:49|00:01:52|costly for the company to try to fix|NA
00:01:51|00:01:54|those mistakes and so that's why a lot|NA
00:01:52|00:01:56|of companies will just err on the side|NA
00:01:54|00:01:59|of not hiring people if they're not|NA
00:01:56|00:02:01|really sure so one funny thing is of|NA
00:01:59|00:02:04|this panel of interviewers it's not like|NA
00:02:01|00:02:06|anyone really has the ability to just|NA
00:02:04|00:02:07|say well yeah we should hire you we want|NA
00:02:06|00:02:09|to be nice to you and just give you that|NA
00:02:07|00:02:11|high higher mark because overall you|NA
00:02:09|00:02:13|will need everybody or most people to|NA
00:02:11|00:02:15|give you that positive higher score|NA
00:02:13|00:02:17|if only one person gives you the a|NA
00:02:15|00:02:19|higher score that's just not going to be|NA
00:02:17|00:02:21|enough however it will be enough if one|NA
00:02:19|00:02:23|person gives a negative score sometimes|NA
00:02:21|00:02:25|you just sync your whole interview|NA
00:02:23|00:02:27|process like if one person just said|NA
00:02:25|00:02:28|that you're a jerk that could be enough|NA
00:02:27|00:02:30|to just think you although not|NA
00:02:28|00:02:32|necessarily you may have noticed by the|NA
00:02:30|00:02:39|way that were several minutes into the|NA
00:02:32|00:02:40|video by now so let's just get into it|NA
00:02:39|00:02:42|let's get into it|NA
00:02:40|00:02:44|tip number one what's tip number one|NA
00:02:42|00:02:46|well let's talk about tip number one and|NA
00:02:44|00:02:49|what I'm going to tell you now is my top|NA
00:02:46|00:02:51|number one tip on what mistake people|NA
00:02:49|00:02:54|make when interviewing for the technical|NA
00:02:51|00:03:00|interview so stay tuned because that's|NA
00:02:54|00:03:02|coming up right now that tip is that tip|NA
00:03:00|00:03:04|is and it's really the only reason that|NA
00:03:02|00:03:07|I thought of making this video really|NA
00:03:04|00:03:10|for you that tip is to get a referral|NA
00:03:07|00:03:12|don't just think that you can do it on|NA
00:03:10|00:03:14|your own and this is one mistake that I|NA
00:03:12|00:03:16|made when I first began applying for|NA
00:03:14|00:03:18|jobs straight out of college I was|NA
00:03:16|00:03:20|thinking hey I'm pretty hot stuff I|NA
00:03:18|00:03:20|don't need help I'm gonna do it on my|NA
00:03:20|00:03:23|own|NA
00:03:20|00:03:24|I don't need my aunts help I don't need|NA
00:03:23|00:03:26|my uncle's help or some distant|NA
00:03:24|00:03:29|relatives help you I'm just gonna do|NA
00:03:26|00:03:31|this on my own I can get A's on tests on|NA
00:03:29|00:03:32|my own I just need to work a little bit|NA
00:03:31|00:03:35|harder and I'm going to have a little|NA
00:03:32|00:03:37|bit of self respect for myself and like|NA
00:03:35|00:03:38|most self-respecting Atos I'm just going|NA
00:03:37|00:03:40|to do this on my own|NA
00:03:38|00:03:43|and that's really not the way that this|NA
00:03:40|00:03:45|works and I remember when I was starting|NA
00:03:43|00:03:47|out and I had no experience and nobody|NA
00:03:45|00:03:49|could vouch for me it was very very|NA
00:03:47|00:03:51|difficult for me to get my first|NA
00:03:49|00:03:53|technical job and I didn't want to ask|NA
00:03:51|00:03:55|anybody for help I didn't really know my|NA
00:03:53|00:03:57|relatives that well my aunt was a|NA
00:03:55|00:03:59|director at the tech company I didn't|NA
00:03:57|00:04:01|want to bother her but she heard I was|NA
00:03:59|00:04:03|looking for a job put in a good word for|NA
00:04:01|00:04:05|me and I managed to get one summer|NA
00:04:03|00:04:07|internship out of that at the tech|NA
00:04:05|00:04:09|company that was juniper Networks and|NA
00:04:07|00:04:12|you may be thinking well yeah fine you|NA
00:04:09|00:04:14|got one small little stupid internship|NA
00:04:12|00:04:16|at the tech company you know who cares|NA
00:04:14|00:04:18|right that's not that big of a deal but|NA
00:04:16|00:04:20|what happened was I kept building on|NA
00:04:18|00:04:24|that and that one little piece angled my|NA
00:04:20|00:04:26|trajectory upwards such that my next job|NA
00:04:24|00:04:27|after that what they saw that I had this|NA
00:04:26|00:04:29|tech internship|NA
00:04:27|00:04:31|and I could just get an internship at|NA
00:04:29|00:04:33|like Microsoft after that if I tried to|NA
00:04:31|00:04:35|apply for say getting Microsoft|NA
00:04:33|00:04:37|intership straight away maybe I wouldn't|NA
00:04:35|00:04:38|have been able to do it if I didn't have|NA
00:04:37|00:04:40|that tech internship maybe I wouldn't|NA
00:04:38|00:04:43|have had any of what I currently have|NA
00:04:40|00:04:45|you know maybe I would just be like a|NA
00:04:43|00:04:46|school system administrator or something|NA
00:04:45|00:04:49|like you know they say that beginnings|NA
00:04:46|00:04:50|are very fragile very delicate and they|NA
00:04:49|00:04:53|say that some of the biggest decisions|NA
00:04:50|00:04:55|in your life are the smallest choices so|NA
00:04:53|00:04:57|just angling your career trajectory a|NA
00:04:55|00:04:59|little bit upwards give me that small|NA
00:04:57|00:05:02|little boost can over time lead you into|NA
00:04:59|00:05:04|that light of success instead of going|NA
00:05:02|00:05:07|down just a very plain mediocre Road and|NA
00:05:04|00:05:09|now looking back I think that referrals|NA
00:05:07|00:05:11|are very important I got a referral I|NA
00:05:09|00:05:12|know a lot of other people who got|NA
00:05:11|00:05:14|referrals and you know these people|NA
00:05:12|00:05:16|don't necessarily need to know you super|NA
00:05:14|00:05:18|well and you don't necessarily need to|NA
00:05:16|00:05:20|be applying for like a really good role|NA
00:05:18|00:05:22|but just having a little bit of help|NA
00:05:20|00:05:25|having the humility to accept that help|NA
00:05:22|00:05:26|I think will go a long way and there's|NA
00:05:25|00:05:29|nothing to be ashamed about I would|NA
00:05:26|00:05:32|encourage you to ask around find out who|NA
00:05:29|00:05:34|in your circle or even outer circle may|NA
00:05:32|00:05:36|be working at some company that you're|NA
00:05:34|00:05:37|interested in and just try to get a|NA
00:05:36|00:05:39|referral from that person you know even|NA
00:05:37|00:05:41|like a summer internship or something|NA
00:05:39|00:05:42|like that it's going to help you a lot|NA
00:05:41|00:05:45|the second tip I have for you is to just|NA
00:05:42|00:05:47|make sure that you're applying I know a|NA
00:05:45|00:05:48|lot of people just get discouraged they|NA
00:05:47|00:05:51|don't apply anymore after they get the|NA
00:05:48|00:05:53|first rejection or two and it really|NA
00:05:51|00:05:54|hits them they get into a sense of|NA
00:05:53|00:05:56|failure they don't want to fail anymore|NA
00:05:54|00:05:58|they don't want to feel rejected anymore|NA
00:05:56|00:06:01|they feel they don't want to waste other|NA
00:05:58|00:06:02|people's time but I was surprised to see|NA
00:06:01|00:06:05|that some people out there are applying|NA
00:06:02|00:06:06|to like a hundred different jobs and you|NA
00:06:05|00:06:09|know I think this is really the right|NA
00:06:06|00:06:12|attitude to have you know even for me I|NA
00:06:09|00:06:14|might apply to like ten jobs and if I|NA
00:06:12|00:06:15|couldn't get any of those ten I would|NA
00:06:14|00:06:18|just be like yeah forget it I'm just|NA
00:06:15|00:06:19|gonna play video games all summer or|NA
00:06:18|00:06:21|something like that and you have to|NA
00:06:19|00:06:23|remember for me I've failed that the|NA
00:06:21|00:06:26|Google interview process like three|NA
00:06:23|00:06:28|times before I finally got in and it's|NA
00:06:26|00:06:30|not necessarily always going to be your|NA
00:06:28|00:06:32|fault a lot of times it's an issue of|NA
00:06:30|00:06:34|timing not having enough budget to hire|NA
00:06:32|00:06:35|for a certain role it could be that that|NA
00:06:34|00:06:37|you're they're just too many other|NA
00:06:35|00:06:39|highly qualified applicants you know|NA
00:06:37|00:06:41|there may be a whole variety of reasons|NA
00:06:39|00:06:42|so I would encourage you to just|NA
00:06:41|00:06:44|not get too discouraged don't take it|NA
00:06:42|00:06:46|personally and you know just make sure|NA
00:06:44|00:06:48|that you study up learn some interview|NA
00:06:46|00:06:50|tips and tricks' brush up your resume|NA
00:06:48|00:06:52|and just keep applying and see what you|NA
00:06:50|00:06:54|can get I strongly believe in|NA
00:06:52|00:06:56|celebrating a culture of failure and|NA
00:06:54|00:06:58|unfortunately that's not the way a lot|NA
00:06:56|00:07:00|of people are these days they would just|NA
00:06:58|00:07:02|say oh you apply then you failed you|NA
00:07:00|00:07:03|know they'll make fun of you for that|NA
00:07:02|00:07:06|don't let them get to you this is the|NA
00:07:03|00:07:07|way the game is played I also know here|NA
00:07:06|00:07:09|that a lot of the people will read|NA
00:07:07|00:07:12|what's in the news like they'll say oh|NA
00:07:09|00:07:14|Google is you know anti conservative and|NA
00:07:12|00:07:16|they're going to just take this one|NA
00:07:14|00:07:18|point that they read in the news and use|NA
00:07:16|00:07:21|that and say yeah I don't want to apply|NA
00:07:18|00:07:22|to some company because I read this|NA
00:07:21|00:07:25|thing in the news and now it's a big|NA
00:07:22|00:07:26|deal you know in reality I don't think|NA
00:07:25|00:07:28|these are very big deals within the|NA
00:07:26|00:07:30|companies like you know a lot of these|NA
00:07:28|00:07:32|companies are working on a million|NA
00:07:30|00:07:34|different things and then one small|NA
00:07:32|00:07:36|piece gets leaked into the news and then|NA
00:07:34|00:07:38|the news media makes a huge deal out of|NA
00:07:36|00:07:39|it and that everyone thinks that this is|NA
00:07:38|00:07:43|such a big deal but in reality I would|NA
00:07:39|00:07:45|say 99% of the time engineers are just|NA
00:07:43|00:07:46|talking about the tech if you're not|NA
00:07:45|00:07:47|interested in messing around with|NA
00:07:46|00:07:49|politics you don't have to don't let|NA
00:07:47|00:07:52|that just consume you or dissuade you|NA
00:07:49|00:07:54|you know I would recommend first get the|NA
00:07:52|00:07:55|offer and then you can think about you|NA
00:07:54|00:07:57|know I think that a lot of times people|NA
00:07:55|00:07:59|would just look for reasons look for|NA
00:07:57|00:08:02|excuses for how they can not challenge|NA
00:07:59|00:08:04|themselves and you don't want to be that|NA
00:08:02|00:08:05|person you know like a lot of these|NA
00:08:04|00:08:08|things they're not as big as you may be|NA
00:08:05|00:08:11|imagining third common mistake for you|NA
00:08:08|00:08:13|is focusing too much on the tech|NA
00:08:11|00:08:15|especially for technical interviews you|NA
00:08:13|00:08:18|may be thinking that all people care|NA
00:08:15|00:08:19|about is how technical you are how fast|NA
00:08:18|00:08:22|can you solve how efficient are you|NA
00:08:19|00:08:24|what's your time space analysis can you|NA
00:08:22|00:08:26|write the code but I don't think it's|NA
00:08:24|00:08:28|really about that you know in the end|NA
00:08:26|00:08:29|people are human the whole process is|NA
00:08:28|00:08:32|human and so remember to show your|NA
00:08:29|00:08:34|friendly side show a little bit humor I|NA
00:08:32|00:08:36|think humor is always great to have like|NA
00:08:34|00:08:38|some business casual humor if you can go|NA
00:08:36|00:08:40|through the interview process with the|NA
00:08:38|00:08:42|attitude of friendly professionalism|NA
00:08:40|00:08:45|where it looks like you're a pretty|NA
00:08:42|00:08:48|chill person who people might want to|NA
00:08:45|00:08:49|hang out with go to offsides with maybe|NA
00:08:48|00:08:51|just get to know a little bit better a|NA
00:08:49|00:08:53|kind of an interesting person kind of|NA
00:08:51|00:08:54|fun then I think that would be great to|NA
00:08:53|00:08:55|show but if you|NA
00:08:54|00:08:58|and you're just super serious and|NA
00:08:55|00:09:01|nervous and anxious and stressed out and|NA
00:08:58|00:09:03|you ace the entire technical portion but|NA
00:09:01|00:09:05|you just don't seem very friendly you|NA
00:09:03|00:09:06|don't you seem kind of distant kind of|NA
00:09:05|00:09:09|aloof then I think that sometimes|NA
00:09:06|00:09:12|subconsciously interviewers who are|NA
00:09:09|00:09:15|human as well maybe a little bit picky|NA
00:09:12|00:09:17|err you know they may just say yeah I|NA
00:09:15|00:09:18|didn't really like your analysis when in|NA
00:09:17|00:09:20|reality maybe they just felt that your|NA
00:09:18|00:09:22|charisma wasn't quite there if you seem|NA
00:09:20|00:09:24|like a really friendly person the|NA
00:09:22|00:09:26|interviewer will be rooting for you|NA
00:09:24|00:09:27|trying to find ways to help you out find|NA
00:09:26|00:09:29|ways to just make sure that you succeed|NA
00:09:27|00:09:32|maybe just working with you better and|NA
00:09:29|00:09:34|that teamwork skill right it's going to|NA
00:09:32|00:09:36|be great to have great just show tip|NA
00:09:34|00:09:38|number four is not preparing I know a|NA
00:09:36|00:09:39|lot of people don't want to prepare for|NA
00:09:38|00:09:42|technical interviews because they think|NA
00:09:39|00:09:44|it's just garbage is ridiculous and|NA
00:09:42|00:09:46|you're right but that's currently the|NA
00:09:44|00:09:48|way the game is played I would recommend|NA
00:09:46|00:09:50|that you prepare two technical things to|NA
00:09:48|00:09:52|talk about things that are of sufficient|NA
00:09:50|00:09:53|technical death and then two personal|NA
00:09:52|00:09:56|stories about yourself about teamwork|NA
00:09:53|00:09:58|about your behavior personality|NA
00:09:56|00:10:00|leadership communication skills working|NA
00:09:58|00:10:02|with conflict things like that and|NA
00:10:00|00:10:04|throughout the interview which is going|NA
00:10:02|00:10:06|to be several hours long you can just|NA
00:10:04|00:10:09|have at least four stories that you can|NA
00:10:06|00:10:10|refer back to and trust me as you're|NA
00:10:09|00:10:12|talking you're going to find plenty of|NA
00:10:10|00:10:13|opportunities to just bring up stories|NA
00:10:12|00:10:16|like this and just bring the|NA
00:10:13|00:10:18|conversation to these stories which are|NA
00:10:16|00:10:19|supposed to be very well crafted and|NA
00:10:18|00:10:21|you'll be able to get to them you know|NA
00:10:19|00:10:24|don't just think that you'll be able to|NA
00:10:21|00:10:26|instantly think up any story to a|NA
00:10:24|00:10:28|question that I might ask you like you|NA
00:10:26|00:10:30|don't want to be the person who two|NA
00:10:28|00:10:32|hours after the interview you remember|NA
00:10:30|00:10:33|oh I should have talked about this story|NA
00:10:32|00:10:35|that that would have been such a great|NA
00:10:33|00:10:38|story I should have toad have it|NA
00:10:35|00:10:40|prepared beforehand there's nothing more|NA
00:10:38|00:10:43|boring to me than interviewing a college|NA
00:10:40|00:10:46|new grad and when I asked like tell me|NA
00:10:43|00:10:48|about some project that you did they say|NA
00:10:46|00:10:50|they've done no projects but only have|NA
00:10:48|00:10:51|college coursework to talk about so that|NA
00:10:50|00:10:53|I said okay fine|NA
00:10:51|00:10:55|tell me about your compilers project|NA
00:10:53|00:10:57|course and they talked about it and it's|NA
00:10:55|00:10:59|pretty boring it's not very impressive|NA
00:10:57|00:11:00|so I would say that if you're in college|NA
00:10:59|00:11:03|or you don't have much more to show|NA
00:11:00|00:11:05|beyond just your basic coursework or if|NA
00:11:03|00:11:06|you feel that your current selection of|NA
00:11:05|00:11:08|projects is not very interesting then|NA
00:11:06|00:11:10|start thinking about|NA
00:11:08|00:11:12|maybe coming up with some independent|NA
00:11:10|00:11:14|project that you can work on you know it|NA
00:11:12|00:11:15|doesn't really have to be very complex I|NA
00:11:14|00:11:18|would say even just building a simple|NA
00:11:15|00:11:19|client with a back-end and communication|NA
00:11:18|00:11:22|between the client and back-end through|NA
00:11:19|00:11:23|some API service is going to be already|NA
00:11:22|00:11:25|very good to talk about you know|NA
00:11:23|00:11:27|sometimes that's all I'm really looking|NA
00:11:25|00:11:28|for and very few people seem to even|NA
00:11:27|00:11:30|have experience like this and what I|NA
00:11:28|00:11:32|want to talk about is like how did you|NA
00:11:30|00:11:34|define the API what was the|NA
00:11:32|00:11:36|communication mechanism did you use JSON|NA
00:11:34|00:11:39|XML how did the client get the data back|NA
00:11:36|00:11:41|how did they use that data what language|NA
00:11:39|00:11:43|was the server written in what technical|NA
00:11:41|00:11:44|challenges there were if you can come up|NA
00:11:43|00:11:46|with stores like this that's going to be|NA
00:11:44|00:11:48|really great to talk about within the|NA
00:11:46|00:11:49|first 10 minutes of the interview say|NA
00:11:48|00:11:50|before the technical whiteboarding|NA
00:11:49|00:11:53|begins|NA
00:11:50|00:11:56|tip number five for you is spending all|NA
00:11:53|00:11:58|of your time on one problem if I ask one|NA
00:11:56|00:12:00|problem I sometimes see that people will|NA
00:11:58|00:12:02|spend the whole time working on that one|NA
00:12:00|00:12:04|problem and assume that that was the|NA
00:12:02|00:12:05|only question that has for you whereas|NA
00:12:04|00:12:07|in reality I had the follow-up question|NA
00:12:05|00:12:09|to that and then I had the second|NA
00:12:07|00:12:10|question I wanted to actually get to and|NA
00:12:09|00:12:12|that would have been the main question|NA
00:12:10|00:12:14|so try to plow through these questions|NA
00:12:12|00:12:16|quicker if you can so remember that even|NA
00:12:14|00:12:19|if you get the problem entirely correct|NA
00:12:16|00:12:20|if you were just really slow and it took|NA
00:12:19|00:12:23|you 30 minutes just to get through that|NA
00:12:20|00:12:26|first portion of the question that's not|NA
00:12:23|00:12:27|going to be enough make sure that you're|NA
00:12:26|00:12:29|working fast and you're keeping an eye|NA
00:12:27|00:12:31|on time but that time is very important|NA
00:12:29|00:12:33|and you want to pack in as much content|NA
00:12:31|00:12:35|into that time as you can to demonstrate|NA
00:12:33|00:12:37|how much you can get through that|NA
00:12:35|00:12:40|productivity efficiency factor is|NA
00:12:37|00:12:42|something to really consider the sixth|NA
00:12:40|00:12:44|tip I have for you is for technical|NA
00:12:42|00:12:46|interviews to remember to write the code|NA
00:12:44|00:12:48|don't just think that all you have to do|NA
00:12:46|00:12:51|is hand wave because people actually|NA
00:12:48|00:12:53|want to see you be able to code see the|NA
00:12:51|00:12:56|code is good too it's fine but sometimes|NA
00:12:53|00:12:58|mix in some real code with semicolons|NA
00:12:56|00:13:00|and variables and all that stuff just so|NA
00:12:58|00:13:02|that you can satisfy those hard core|NA
00:13:00|00:13:03|engineers some of them just want to make|NA
00:13:02|00:13:05|sure that you can actually code and|NA
00:13:03|00:13:07|remember that has come in these days for|NA
00:13:05|00:13:10|people to take a picture of the code|NA
00:13:07|00:13:12|that you wrote at the end that is used|NA
00:13:10|00:13:13|as a record and what I've know this is a|NA
00:13:12|00:13:15|lot of the people can hand wave talk|NA
00:13:13|00:13:17|about what a solution might look like|NA
00:13:15|00:13:20|but until you can actually put the code|NA
00:13:17|00:13:22|down the credit that you get for that is|NA
00:13:20|00:13:24|not going to be as significant|NA
00:13:22|00:13:25|as it should be to be extra clear just|NA
00:13:24|00:13:27|make sure that you put the coat down|NA
00:13:25|00:13:29|onto the wall along with this I want to|NA
00:13:27|00:13:31|remind you to make sure that your resume|NA
00:13:29|00:13:33|is also very clear about the projects|NA
00:13:31|00:13:35|that you've done when I write feedback|NA
00:13:33|00:13:38|for a candidate I will often use the|NA
00:13:35|00:13:40|resume as a reference to remember what|NA
00:13:38|00:13:42|we talked about and if I'm reading your|NA
00:13:40|00:13:43|resume and it's usually a bunch of|NA
00:13:42|00:13:45|technical mumbo-jumbo|NA
00:13:43|00:13:47|and I can't figure out what you actually|NA
00:13:45|00:13:49|did and I don't remember and if your|NA
00:13:47|00:13:53|resume just said utilize|NA
00:13:49|00:13:55|enterprise-class Java Ajax Hyperion|NA
00:13:53|00:13:57|technical note interfaces to integrate|NA
00:13:55|00:13:58|quantum-mechanical artificial|NA
00:13:57|00:14:00|intelligence well that sounds really|NA
00:13:58|00:14:02|great but I really have no idea whether|NA
00:14:00|00:14:03|it was and I'm not going to put that|NA
00:14:02|00:14:05|into the feedback because I don't even|NA
00:14:03|00:14:08|know what it was about the seventh tip I|NA
00:14:05|00:14:09|have for you is not focusing on analysis|NA
00:14:08|00:14:11|enough a lot of people are really eager|NA
00:14:09|00:14:14|to code really eager to just start|NA
00:14:11|00:14:16|writing stuff they don't teach you|NA
00:14:14|00:14:18|analysis as much as they should in|NA
00:14:16|00:14:20|college but the first thing to do is|NA
00:14:18|00:14:22|really to analyze and talk through what|NA
00:14:20|00:14:24|your solution may look like talk about|NA
00:14:22|00:14:26|that time space analysis otherwise what|NA
00:14:24|00:14:28|are you even writing right what are we|NA
00:14:26|00:14:31|even coding here is this even going to|NA
00:14:28|00:14:32|work you know and then sometimes I see|NA
00:14:31|00:14:34|people just start writing their|NA
00:14:32|00:14:36|recursion right in there for loops and|NA
00:14:34|00:14:38|just like what is this what is this even|NA
00:14:36|00:14:40|supposed to be didn't we think about|NA
00:14:38|00:14:42|this or are we just starting to code|NA
00:14:40|00:14:44|here not all companies but some|NA
00:14:42|00:14:47|companies will actually first write a|NA
00:14:44|00:14:49|design dog evaluating the alternatives|NA
00:14:47|00:14:51|before they actually start writing code|NA
00:14:49|00:14:53|if you just start writing code you're|NA
00:14:51|00:14:55|kind of doing things backwards in some|NA
00:14:53|00:14:57|scenarios I have one more bonus tip for|NA
00:14:55|00:14:59|you which is to enjoy your lunch you|NA
00:14:57|00:15:02|know this is your one chance to go pick|NA
00:14:59|00:15:04|out at the cafeteria so I recommend just|NA
00:15:02|00:15:06|eating as much as you like you know it's|NA
00:15:04|00:15:08|a buffet save your appetite for it and|NA
00:15:06|00:15:10|when you're done eating ask for dessert|NA
00:15:08|00:15:12|you know don't be shy about it just be|NA
00:15:10|00:15:14|like yeah I want two desserts I'm just|NA
00:15:12|00:15:17|gonna go eat like all of this stuff and|NA
00:15:14|00:15:19|then when the interviewer asks you on|NA
00:15:17|00:15:21|your way out like if you want drink yeah|NA
00:15:19|00:15:23|go grab a drink sample some of the|NA
00:15:21|00:15:25|snacks sample some of the food grab a|NA
00:15:23|00:15:27|drink try things out a lot of people|NA
00:15:25|00:15:29|seem to just get boring water and I just|NA
00:15:27|00:15:32|think it's kind of wasted like I think|NA
00:15:29|00:15:34|it's great I would do with FRU my last|NA
00:15:32|00:15:36|and final tip and the best tip of all is|NA
00:15:34|00:15:37|a lot of people don't prepare them|NA
00:15:36|00:15:39|fundamentally they don't learn they|NA
00:15:37|00:15:41|don't have that technical knowledge and|NA
00:15:39|00:15:44|you can get that for yourself by|NA
00:15:41|00:15:46|checking out brilliant org this is a|NA
00:15:44|00:15:48|great website for learning computer|NA
00:15:46|00:15:50|science fundamentals algorithms|NA
00:15:48|00:15:52|mathematics probability statistics and a|NA
00:15:50|00:15:54|lot of fun because you can go through|NA
00:15:52|00:15:56|various problem sets there are problems|NA
00:15:54|00:15:58|and solutions with thorough explanations|NA
00:15:56|00:16:00|and there are a wide variety of topics|NA
00:15:58|00:16:02|so you can focus on whichever area that|NA
00:16:00|00:16:03|you feel you need more help on I might|NA
00:16:02|00:16:06|also recommend for you to check out|NA
00:16:03|00:16:08|their statistics or probability section|NA
00:16:06|00:16:10|anytime a candidate that comes to me and|NA
00:16:08|00:16:12|starts busting out their statistics and|NA
00:16:10|00:16:14|probability skills I'm usually pretty|NA
00:16:12|00:16:16|impressed even if they're computer|NA
00:16:14|00:16:17|science core fundamentals are not that|NA
00:16:16|00:16:19|strong|NA
00:16:17|00:16:22|I might still say well hey they seem to|NA
00:16:19|00:16:24|have really good analytical skills for|NA
00:16:22|00:16:26|probability and statistics you know|NA
00:16:24|00:16:28|every company is very metric space these|NA
00:16:26|00:16:29|days they use a lot of this stuff and so|NA
00:16:28|00:16:31|if you expand your knowledge out into|NA
00:16:29|00:16:33|other areas and then mention that in the|NA
00:16:31|00:16:36|interviews I think that can also reflect|NA
00:16:33|00:16:39|positively for you so that'll for me let|NA
00:16:36|00:16:41|me know if you have any tips for common|NA
00:16:39|00:16:42|mistakes people make in interviews if|NA
00:16:41|00:16:47|you liked the video give it a like and|NA

00:01:32|00:01:37|<st> Since the early 1970s conspiracy theorists have created ever more elaborate stories about|A
00:01:37|00:01:43|how NASA faked the moon landings, much to the annoyance of the literal hundreds of thousands|NA
00:01:43|00:01:49|of people who worked in some capacity to make these missions a reality, and even more so|NA
00:01:49|00:01:53|to the men who were brave enough to sit in front of a massive controlled explosion, take|NA
00:01:53|00:01:59|a little jaunt through the soul crushing void of space in an extremely complex ship built|NA
00:01:59|00:02:04|by the lowest bidder, then get into another spacecraft whose ascent engine had never been|NA
00:02:04|00:02:10|test fired before they lit the candle, and all with the goal of exiting said ship with|NA
00:02:10|00:02:13|only a special suit between them and oblivion.|NA
00:02:13|00:02:18|And don't even get the astronauts started on the paltry government salary they earned|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|in doing all that and the hilarious lengths they had to go to to provide some semblance|NA
00:02:22|00:02:27|of a life insurance policy for their families should the worst happen during the missions.|NA
00:02:27|00:02:31|So who first got the idea that the moon landings were faked?|NA
00:02:31|00:02:36|While it's highly likely there were at least a few individuals here and there who doubted|NA
00:02:36|00:02:41|man could accomplish such a thing a little over a half century after the end of period|NA
00:02:41|00:02:46|in which humans were still hitching up covered wagons, the first to really get the moon landing|NA
00:02:46|00:02:50|hoax story going popularly was a writer named Bill Kaysing.|NA
00:02:50|00:02:52|How did he do it?|NA
00:02:52|00:02:57|Kaysing self-published a book in 1976 called We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty|NA
00:02:57|00:02:59|Billion Dollar Swindle.|NA
00:02:59|00:03:04|Released a few years after the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, Kaysing’s book popularly introduced|NA
00:03:04|00:03:08|some of the most well known talking points of moon landing deniers, such as that the|NA
00:03:08|00:03:13|astronauts should have been killed when they passed through the Van Allen radiation belts,|NA
00:03:13|00:03:18|noting the lack of stars in photographs, the missing blast crater below the lunar modules,|NA
00:03:18|00:03:19|etc.|NA
00:03:19|00:03:24|"Beyond these, he also had some more, let's say, ""unusual"" and occasionally offensive"|NA
00:03:24|00:03:29|assertions which even the most ardent moon landing denier would probably rather distance|NA
00:03:29|00:03:30|themselves from.|NA
00:03:30|00:03:35|Not exactly a best-seller, Kaysing's book nonetheless laid the ground work for some|NA
00:03:35|00:03:40|of what would come after, with the idea further gaining steam in part thanks to the 1978 film|NA
00:03:40|00:03:46|Capricorn 1, which shows NASA faking a Mars landing and then going to any lengths to keep|NA
00:03:46|00:03:47|it a secret.|NA
00:03:47|00:03:52|As for the film, director Peter Hyams states he first got the idea for such a movie when|NA
00:03:52|00:03:57|"musing over the Apollo 11 mission and thinking, ""There was one event of really enormous importance"|NA
00:03:57|00:03:59|that had almost no witnesses.|NA
00:03:59|00:04:02|"And the only verification we have . . . came from a TV camera."""|NA
00:04:02|00:04:06|Not an accurate statement in the slightest on the latter point, it nonetheless got the|NA
00:04:06|00:04:11|wheels turning and he ultimately developed a script based on this notion.|NA
00:04:11|00:04:15|As to how Kaysing before him came to the conclusion that NASA faked the moon landings, the story,|NA
00:04:15|00:04:20|at least as Kaysing tells it, is that in the late 1950s he managed to view the results|NA
00:04:20|00:04:25|of a highly secretive internal study conducted by NASA on the feasibility of man successfully|NA
00:04:25|00:04:30|landing on the moon that concluded, in his own words: “That the chance of success was|NA
00:04:30|00:04:32|something like .0017 percent.|NA
00:04:32|00:04:36|In other words, it was hopeless.”|NA
00:04:36|00:04:40|Kaysing doesn't explain how NASA came up with such a precise figure given all the unknown|NA
00:04:40|00:04:45|"variables at the time, nor why he put the qualifier ""something like"" followed by such"|NA
00:04:45|00:04:47|an extremely exact number.|NA
00:04:47|00:04:49|He also did not name the report itself.|NA
00:04:49|00:04:54|And, in fact, as far as we can tell, NASA never conducted such an all encompassing study|NA
00:04:54|00:04:58|on the feasibility of a successful moon landing in the 1950s.|NA
00:04:58|00:05:02|Whether they did or not, we did find in our research looking for that report that NASA|NA
00:05:02|00:05:07|conducted a feasibility study on the proposed designs for several manned rockets immediately|NA
00:05:07|00:05:11|prior to Apollo program to decide which contractor to use.|NA
00:05:11|00:05:15|This, of course, has nothing to do with Kaysing, but we figured we’d mention it as we like|NA
00:05:15|00:05:21|to deal in facts and reading Kaysing's various works has us feeling like we need to be cleansed|NA
00:05:21|00:05:25|a little by saying things that are actually true about NASA in this period.|NA
00:05:25|00:05:29|In any event, Kaysing would later assert that he determined from this report that there’s|NA
00:05:29|00:05:36|no way NASA could have improved these 0.0017% odds in the time between the results of this|NA
00:05:36|00:05:40|supposed study and the moon landings about a decade later.|NA
00:05:40|00:05:46|Now, if Kaysing was just some random guy shouting in the wind, it's unlikely anyone would have|NA
00:05:46|00:05:47|listened to him.|NA
00:05:47|00:05:52|Every conspiracy theory origin story needs at least some shred of credibility from the|NA
00:05:52|00:05:55|person starting it to get the fire going.|NA
00:05:55|00:05:59|For Kaysing’s assertions about the moon landings, this comes in the form of the fact|NA
00:05:59|00:06:04|that for a brief period he worked for Rocketdyne, a company that made rockets for the Apollo|NA
00:06:04|00:06:05|program.|NA
00:06:05|00:06:10|Not an engineer or having any similar technical expertise whatsoever, Kaysing's background|NA
00:06:10|00:06:15|was primarily in writing, earning an English degree from the University of Redlands, after|NA
00:06:15|00:06:18|which he naturally got a job making furniture.|NA
00:06:18|00:06:22|As for the writing gig he landed with Rocketdyne, his job was initially as a technical writer|NA
00:06:22|00:06:28|starting in 1956 and he eventually worked his way up to head of technical publications.|NA
00:06:28|00:06:33|He finally quit in 1963, deciding he'd had enough of working for the man.|NA
00:06:33|00:06:38|After quitting, to quote him, “the rat race”, in 1963 Kaysing traveled the country in a|NA
00:06:38|00:06:42|trailer with his family, earning his living writing books on a variety of topics from|NA
00:06:42|00:06:44|motorcycles to farming.|NA
00:06:44|00:06:48|This brings us to 1969 when he, like most everyone else in the world with access to|NA
00:06:48|00:06:50|a TV watched the moon landing.|NA
00:06:50|00:06:54|While watching, Kaysing recalled the supposed NASA study he’d seen all those years ago,|NA
00:06:54|00:06:58|as well as that engineers he'd worked with at the time in the late 1950s claimed that|NA
00:06:58|00:07:03|while the technology existed to get the astronauts to the moon, getting them back was not yet|NA
00:07:03|00:07:04|possible.|NA
00:07:04|00:07:08|He later stated he further thought, “As late as 1967 three astronauts died in|NA
00:07:08|00:07:09|a horrendous fire on the launch pad.|NA
00:07:09|00:07:14|But as of '69, we could suddenly perform manned flight upon manned flight?|NA
00:07:14|00:07:15|With complete success?|NA
00:07:15|00:07:18|It's just against all statistical odds.”|NA
00:07:18|00:07:22|Despite often describing himself as “the fastest pen in the west”, it would take|NA
00:07:22|00:07:27|Kaysing several years to write the book that introduced one of the most enduring conspiracy|NA
00:07:27|00:07:29|theories to the world.|NA
00:07:29|00:07:32|As for why NASA would bother with the charade, he claimed NASA worked in tandem with the|NA
00:07:32|00:07:38|Defence Intelligence Agency to fake the moon landings to one up those pesky Russians.|NA
00:07:38|00:07:42|While certainly good for the country if they could get away with it, the benefit to NASA|NA
00:07:42|00:07:44|itself was, of course, funding.|NA
00:07:44|00:07:49|"Said Kaysing, ""They - both NASA and Rocketdyne - wanted the money to keep pouring in."""|NA
00:07:49|00:07:55|"As to how he knew this, he goes on ""I've worked in aerospace long enough to know that's their"|NA
00:07:55|00:07:56|"goal."""|NA
00:07:56|00:07:57|So how did NASA do it?|NA
00:07:57|00:08:01|He claimed that the footage of the moon landing was actually filmed on a soundstage.|NA
00:08:01|00:08:04|When later asked where this soundstage was located, Kaysing confidently stated that it|NA
00:08:04|00:08:06|was located in Area 51.|NA
00:08:06|00:08:09|As he doesn't seem to have ever given clear evidence as to how he knew this, we can only|NA
00:08:09|00:08:16|assume because it’s not a proper space related conspiracy theory if Area 51 isn't mentioned.|NA
00:08:16|00:08:21|Kaysing also claimed that the F-1 engines used were too unreliable so NASA instead put|NA
00:08:21|00:08:24|several B-1 rockets inside each of the F-1 engines.|NA
00:08:24|00:08:28|Of course, in truth these wouldn't have been powerful enough to get the Saturn V into orbit|NA
00:08:28|00:08:30|even if its tanks were mostly empty.|NA
00:08:30|00:08:35|(And given the frost and ice clearly visible covering certain relevant parts of the Saturn|NA
00:08:35|00:08:39|V here, it's apparent the tanks could not have been mostly empty).|NA
00:08:39|00:08:43|There's also the little problem that the clusters of B-1s he described couldn't have fit in|NA
00:08:43|00:08:48|the F-1 engine bells and you can see footage of the F-1 engines working as advertised,|NA
00:08:48|00:08:51|with no clusters of engines anywhere in sight.|NA
00:08:51|00:08:54|Nevertheless, despite these problems with his story, he did purport that the Saturn|NA
00:08:54|00:08:59|V was launched to space as shown (though at other times has claimed that in fact as soon|NA
00:08:59|00:09:03|as the rocket was out of sight it was simply ditched in the ocean and never made it to|NA
00:09:03|00:09:04|space).|NA
00:09:04|00:09:09|Stick with us here people, he changed his story a lot over the years.|NA
00:09:09|00:09:14|Whatever the case, in all initial cases, he claims the astronauts were not aboard.|NA
00:09:14|00:09:18|(And if you're now wondering how the U.S. fooled the Soviets and other nations tracking|NA
00:09:18|00:09:22|the rockets during these missions, he claims a way to fake signals was devised, allowing|NA
00:09:22|00:09:27|for tracking stations on Earth to think the craft was headed for the moon and, critically,|NA
00:09:27|00:09:31|successfully fooling the Soviets who were indeed closely tracking the missions to the|NA
00:09:31|00:09:33|moon and back.)|NA
00:09:33|00:09:38|So what did Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins do during the mission if they|NA
00:09:38|00:09:41|weren’t zipping around in space?|NA
00:09:41|00:09:45|In the first edition of his book, Kaysing claims that they flew to Las Vegas where they|NA
00:09:45|00:09:50|mostly hung out at strip clubs when they weren't in their rooms on the 24th floor of the Sands|NA
00:09:50|00:09:51|Hotel.|NA
00:09:51|00:09:54|We can't make this stuff up, but apparently Kaysing can.|NA
00:09:54|00:09:58|Kaysing goes on that at one point one of the trio got into a fistfight with someone in|NA
00:09:58|00:10:01|broad daylight over a stripper.|NA
00:10:01|00:10:05|Sadly Kaysing doesn’t reveal which of the men did this, nor how he knew about it, so|NA
00:10:05|00:10:08|we’re forced to assume it was Buzz Aldrin who is the only member of the three we definitely|NA
00:10:08|00:10:11|know actually has gotten in a fist fight.|NA
00:10:11|00:10:16|In this case, in 2002, a 72 year old Buzz Aldrin punched Bart Sibrel who is a “we|NA
00:10:16|00:10:21|never landed on the moon” conspiracy theorist, “documentary” maker, and cab driver.|NA
00:10:21|00:10:25|Sibrel invited Aldrin to a hotel with Sibrel telling him he was making a children’s TV|NA
00:10:25|00:10:26|show on space.|NA
00:10:26|00:10:30|Once Aldrin arrived at the hotel, Sibrel pulled out a Bible and tried to get Aldrin to put|NA
00:10:30|00:10:33|his hand on it and swear that he had walked on the moon.|NA
00:10:33|00:10:35|Needless to say, Aldrin was pretty irritated at this point.|NA
00:10:35|00:10:39|Things got worse when Sibrel called Aldrin a “liar” and a “coward”, at which|NA
00:10:39|00:10:41|point Aldrin punched him.|NA
00:10:41|00:10:47|"As for his defense, Sibrel states, ""When someone has gotten away with a crime, in my opinion,"|NA
00:10:47|00:10:49|they deserve to be ambushed.|NA
00:10:49|00:10:51|"I'm a journalist trying to get at the truth."""|NA
00:10:51|00:10:56|"Unwilling to sway on what that truth is, however, Sibrel states, ""I do know the moon landings"|NA
00:10:56|00:10:57|were faked.|NA
00:10:57|00:10:58|"I'd bet my life on it."""|NA
00:10:58|00:11:02|"Not all is lost, however, because he states, ""I know personally that Trump knows the moon"|NA
00:11:02|00:11:07|landings are fake and he’s biding his time to reveal it at the end of this term, or at|NA
00:11:07|00:11:09|"the end of his second term if he’s re-elected."""|NA
00:11:09|00:11:14|So, rest easy everyone, the truth will come out soon enough apparently.|NA
00:11:14|00:11:17|In any event, going back to Kaysing’s book, he states that shortly before the astronauts|NA
00:11:17|00:11:22|were supposed to begin broadcasting from the moon, all three men arrived on a soundstage|NA
00:11:22|00:11:25|deep within the confines of Area 51 and ate cheese sandwiches.|NA
00:11:25|00:11:31|He also states that along with cheese sandwiches, NASA provided the men with buxom showgirls|NA
00:11:31|00:11:32|while at Area 51.|NA
00:11:32|00:11:37|Presumably this was the only way to pry the astronauts away from the strip clubs.|NA
00:11:37|00:11:42|After eating the no doubt delicious sandwiches, Aldrin and Armstrong put on some space suits|NA
00:11:42|00:11:47|and pretended to walk across a fake moon set while reading out some, to quote Kaysing,|NA
00:11:47|00:11:52|“well-rehearsed lines” in a performance he called “not great” but “good enough”.|NA
00:11:52|00:11:56|A description we personally feel is a little unfair considering it has apparently fooled|NA
00:11:56|00:12:01|seemingly every scientist on Earth then to now, including ones working for the nation|NA
00:12:01|00:12:07|directly competing with the US to land on the moon who would have relished any opportunity|NA
00:12:07|00:12:13|to even allege the whole thing was faked in a credible way, let alone prove it and embarrass|NA
00:12:13|00:12:15|the U.S. utterly in front of the whole world.|NA
00:12:15|00:12:19|But, unfortunately, as you might imagine, the Soviets at the time were monitoring the|NA
00:12:19|00:12:24|whole thing quite closely with their newfangled technology and so never got the opportunity|NA
00:12:24|00:12:26|to disprove the landings.|NA
00:12:26|00:12:30|Amazingly Kaysing also claimed in his book that the fake moon landing footage was filmed|NA
00:12:30|00:12:35|live and that there was only “a seven second delay” between Armstrong and Aldrin’s|NA
00:12:35|00:12:38|performance and the broadcast the world was watching.|NA
00:12:38|00:12:42|Thus, had even a fly buzzed across the set, NASA would have only seconds to notice and|NA
00:12:42|00:12:48|cut the feed, lest such a mistake or inconsistency be noticed in the footage people would be|NA
00:12:48|00:12:50|watching for the rest of human history.|NA
00:12:50|00:12:55|As for the splash down and recovery, he claims the astronauts were eventually put on a military|NA
00:12:55|00:13:00|cargo plane (a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy) and simply dropped from it in the capsule.|NA
00:13:00|00:13:04|As for how he knew this, he did provide a source for once, claiming that an airline|NA
00:13:04|00:13:07|pilot he talked to had seen the Apollo 15 module drop from a cargo plane.|NA
00:13:07|00:13:11|Who this pilot was, what airline he worked for, if he offered any evidence to support|NA
00:13:11|00:13:16|his claim, such as a flight log showing him piloting a plane in the area during the time|NA
00:13:16|00:13:21|of the splash down of Apollo 15, or even when he talked to said pilot, however, he fails|NA
00:13:21|00:13:22|to mention.|NA
00:13:22|00:13:26|As for the moon rocks brought back, these were apparently meteorites found in Antarctica|NA
00:13:26|00:13:29|as well as some that were cleverly made in a NASA geology lab.|NA
00:13:29|00:13:33|As to how NASA was able to keep the lid on things, despite nearly a half a million people|NA
00:13:33|00:13:38|working on the Apollo Program in some capacity, not just for NASA but countless independent|NA
00:13:38|00:13:43|organizations, he claims NASA simply only let those who needed to know the whole thing|NA
00:13:43|00:13:44|was a hoax know.|NA
00:13:44|00:13:48|So following this reasoning that means all these scientists, engineers, etc. working|NA
00:13:48|00:13:53|on all the components and various facets of the mission were genuinely trying to make|NA
00:13:53|00:13:57|the moon landing happen, including knowing the requirements to make it happen and testing|NA
00:13:57|00:14:00|everything they made until it met those requirements...|NA
00:14:00|00:14:04|Meaning what was built and planned should have been capable of doing what the mission|NA
00:14:04|00:14:05|required...|NA
00:14:05|00:14:09|That said, Kaysing admits a handful of people here and there would have had to know the|NA
00:14:09|00:14:15|whole thing was a sham, and thus NASA simply paid off those who could be paid off, promoted|NA
00:14:15|00:14:19|those who preferred that reward, threatened those who still wouldn't go along, and murdered|NA
00:14:19|00:14:23|those who still resisted, which we'll get into shortly.|NA
00:14:23|00:14:28|The ridiculousness of many of these claims and how easily they crumple under the slightest|NA
00:14:28|00:14:34|bit of scrutiny is likely why in the 2002 re-release of his book Kaysing changed his|NA
00:14:34|00:14:39|story in various ways, including claiming that the engines on the Saturn V actually|NA
00:14:39|00:14:44|did work and that Collins, Aldrin and Armstrong did go to space after all, instead of going|NA
00:14:44|00:14:46|to hang out with strippers in Vegas.|NA
00:14:46|00:14:50|He then states that all three men orbited the planet while pre-recorded, not live, footage|NA
00:14:50|00:14:52|was shown on Earth.|NA
00:14:52|00:14:57|Despite, to put it mildly, straining credibility on pretty much everything he said from start|NA
00:14:57|00:15:02|to finish and him providing absurdly specific details, generally without bothering to provide|NA
00:15:02|00:15:06|any evidence whatsoever backing up these claims and changing those specific details frequently|NA
00:15:06|00:15:11|over time, Kaysing’s book and subsequent work nonetheless helped spawn the still thriving|NA
00:15:11|00:15:14|moon landing hoax conspiracy theory.|NA
00:15:14|00:15:16|As for Kaysing, he didn't stop there.|NA
00:15:16|00:15:20|He continued to sporadically come up with new allegations against NASA, including that|NA
00:15:20|00:15:25|the agency murdered the astronauts and teacher aboard the Challenger explosion.|NA
00:15:25|00:15:28|Why would they do this when the whole Christa McAuliffe thing was supposed to be a publicity|NA
00:15:28|00:15:35|stunt to get the public more interested in space travel, science, and what NASA was doing?|NA
00:15:35|00:15:39|According to Kaysing, “Christa McAuliffe, the only civilian and only woman aboard, refused|NA
00:15:39|00:15:42|to go along with the lie that you couldn't see stars in space.|NA
00:15:42|00:15:47|So they blew her up, along with six other people, to keep that lie under wraps...”|NA
00:15:47|00:15:51|Speaking of things that Kaysing said that are ridiculously easy to debunk with even|NA
00:15:51|00:15:54|a modicum of effort, we feel obligated to point out that Christa McAuliffe was not the|NA
00:15:54|00:15:56|only woman on board.|NA
00:15:56|00:16:00|NASA astronaut Judith Resnik was also killed in that tragedy.|NA
00:16:00|00:16:05|Not stopping there, Kaysing also claimed the deaths of the Apollo 1 astronauts were intentional|NA
00:16:05|00:16:09|as one or more of the astronauts aboard was about to blow the whistle on the upcoming|NA
00:16:09|00:16:10|hoax plan.|NA
00:16:10|00:16:14|We feel obligated to point out here that, as previously mentioned, he also used this|NA
00:16:14|00:16:18|fire as evidence of NASA lacking expertise to get a man to the moon...|NA
00:16:18|00:16:23|Meaning according to Kaysing this fire was somehow both intentional to murder a few astronauts|NA
00:16:23|00:16:26|and also accidental owing to NASA's incompetence.|NA
00:16:26|00:16:31|Moving swiftly on, NASA officials also apparently had others killed, including safety inspector|NA
00:16:31|00:16:36|at North American Aviation Thomas Baron who wrote a report on NASA safety protocol violations|NA
00:16:36|00:16:38|after that tragic Apollo 1 fire.|NA
00:16:38|00:16:43|It's at this point, we should probably note that in the 1990s Kaysing decided to sue Jim|NA
00:16:43|00:16:44|Lovell.|NA
00:16:44|00:16:47|"You see, in 1996 Lovell publicly stated ""The guy is wacky."|NA
00:16:47|00:16:49|His position makes me feel angry.|NA
00:16:49|00:16:52|We spent a lot of time getting ready to go to the moon.|NA
00:16:52|00:16:56|We spent a lot of money, we took great risks, and it's something everybody in this country|NA
00:16:56|00:16:57|"should be proud of."""|NA
00:16:57|00:17:02|"Lovell also wrote to Kaysing asking him to ""Tear up your manuscript and pursue a project"|NA
00:17:02|00:17:03|that has some meaning.|NA
00:17:03|00:17:08|"Leave a legacy you can be proud of, not some trash whose readers will doubt your sanity."""|NA
00:17:08|00:17:12|Unwilling to stand for his good name being publicly besmirched, Kaysing naturally sued|NA
00:17:12|00:17:16|Lovell for defamation, though the case was eventually dismissed and nothing ever came|NA
00:17:16|00:17:17|of it.|NA
00:17:17|00:17:20|Kaysing continued to assert that the moon landings were a hoax right up until his death|NA
00:17:20|00:17:27|in 2005, in between writing books on cookery, motorcycle safety, farming, taxes, survival,|NA
00:17:27|00:17:31|how to subsist on very little money, and travel guides, as well as making occasional appearances|NA
00:17:31|00:17:36|on such shows as Oprah expounding on his conspiracy theory work.|NA
00:17:36|00:17:40|On the side he also promoted micro-housing as a solution for homeless people and ran|NA
00:17:40|00:17:44|"a cat sanctuary called ""FLOCK"", standing for ""For the Love of Cats and Kittens""."|NA
00:17:44|00:17:49|So, yes, Kaysing was a man whose passions included micro housing, cats, survival, travel,|NA
00:17:49|00:17:52|living off almost nothing, and rapidly coming up with conspiracy theories.|NA
00:17:52|00:17:57|If only he'd been born later or the interwebs invented sooner, this man could have been|NA
00:17:57|00:17:58|an internet superstar.|NA
00:17:58|00:18:02|Whatever the case, Kaysing’s death understandably garnered a mixed reaction from the scientific|NA
00:18:02|00:18:07|community, with few finding the ability to muster much sympathy for a man who accused|NA
00:18:07|00:18:09|NASA of murdering people.|NA
00:18:09|00:18:13|Gone but not forgotten, Kaysing's ideas have actually gained in popularity in recent years,|NA
00:18:13|00:18:17|particularly among younger generations according to various polls, such as one done by space|NA
00:18:17|00:18:25|consultant Mary Dittmar in 2005 showing that 25% of people 18-25 doubted man had ever walked|NA
00:18:25|00:18:26|on the moon.|NA
00:18:26|00:18:30|This is all despite the fact that it's never been easier to definitively debunk Kaysing's|NA
00:18:30|00:18:31|various assertions.|NA
00:18:31|00:18:37|Not just via reading the countless explanations by scientists definitively addressing point|NA
00:18:37|00:18:43|by point every idea ever put forth by moon landing conspiracy theorists, there's also|NA
00:18:43|00:18:47|the fact that there are literally pictures taken in the last decade showing clear evidence|NA
00:18:47|00:18:53|of some of the equipment sitting on the moon, including for the Apollo 11, 14, 15, 16, and|NA
00:18:53|00:18:55|17 landing sites.|NA
00:18:55|00:19:00|Even in some cases showing the tracks left by the astronauts and the shadows from the|NA
00:19:00|00:19:02|flags planted themselves.|NA
00:19:02|00:19:07|Naturally, moon landing deniers simply claim these photos too were faked, although why|NA

00:00:13|00:00:17|mentioned in passing in a previous video|NA
00:00:15|00:00:20|that I could get a good laminar flow|NA
00:00:17|00:00:21|from my kitchen taps which is nice but I|NA
00:00:20|00:00:22|also noticed something really strange|NA
00:00:21|00:00:24|recently|NA
00:00:22|00:00:27|not just from this particular kitchen|NA
00:00:24|00:00:29|tap but from any laminar flow really|NA
00:00:27|00:00:31|coming from a faucet what's this look|NA
00:00:29|00:00:34|what happens when I put my finger into|NA
00:00:31|00:00:40|the stream of water I got these ripples|NA
00:00:34|00:00:47|above my finger look as I move my finger|NA
00:00:40|00:00:50|down the ripples get tighter get broader|NA
00:00:47|00:00:51|strange my kitchen isn't the best|NA
00:00:50|00:00:53|environment to investigate this sort of|NA
00:00:51|00:00:55|phenomena so I set something up in my|NA
00:00:53|00:00:56|studio I really wanted to see if we can|NA
00:00:55|00:00:58|figure out where these ripples come from|NA
00:00:56|00:01:01|but I also wanted to capture a really|NA
00:00:58|00:01:02|good example of it the first thing you|NA
00:01:01|00:01:05|need is you need that flow of water to|NA
00:01:02|00:01:08|be really stable really consistent I|NA
00:01:05|00:01:10|managed to achieve that with this funnel|NA
00:01:08|00:01:12|and just some cloth over the bottom of|NA
00:01:10|00:01:13|it you get this beautiful laminar flow|NA
00:01:12|00:01:14|from this setup|NA
00:01:13|00:01:20|a lot of other considerations as well|NA
00:01:14|00:01:22|but let's just see what we got it's not|NA
00:01:20|00:01:25|amazing as soon as the obstruction goes|NA
00:01:22|00:01:27|in those standing waves just suddenly|NA
00:01:25|00:01:30|appear it seems like further downstream|NA
00:01:27|00:01:33|the the ripples are tighter and then as|NA
00:01:30|00:01:36|you move up the stream they get wider|NA
00:01:33|00:01:39|look at this so cool is that a standing|NA
00:01:36|00:01:41|wave what is it I also noticed that|NA
00:01:39|00:01:42|there are sweet spots like if the|NA
00:01:41|00:01:46|obstruction isn't in quite the right|NA
00:01:42|00:01:49|place you get these vibrations but one|NA
00:01:46|00:01:50|of these reports come from well for one|NA
00:01:49|00:01:52|thing you definitely need laminar flow|NA
00:01:50|00:01:53|I've mentioned that a couple of times|NA
00:01:52|00:01:55|I've not really said what it is but|NA
00:01:53|00:01:58|imagine this imagine you've got a column|NA
00:01:55|00:02:00|of water like we have and it's all|NA
00:01:58|00:02:02|streaming downwards but the water is|NA
00:02:00|00:02:04|traveling at different speeds so maybe|NA
00:02:02|00:02:06|on the inside the water is traveling|NA
00:02:04|00:02:09|more quickly than on the outside and|NA
00:02:06|00:02:11|with laminar flow you don't have any|NA
00:02:09|00:02:14|interaction between those layers of|NA
00:02:11|00:02:18|different speed they just kind of slide|NA
00:02:14|00:02:19|past each other if water was transferred|NA
00:02:18|00:02:20|between those layers|NA
00:02:19|00:02:22|of different speeds then you'd end up|NA
00:02:20|00:02:24|with turbulent flow which is like the|NA
00:02:22|00:02:27|opposite of laminar flow you can see it|NA
00:02:24|00:02:31|really well with the smoke from a candle|NA
00:02:27|00:02:32|so to begin with the smoke rises through|NA
00:02:31|00:02:34|the still air around it but doesn't|NA
00:02:32|00:02:37|interact with it at all but eventually|NA
00:02:34|00:02:40|it catches if you like on the air around|NA
00:02:37|00:02:43|it and creates these turbulent spinning|NA
00:02:40|00:02:44|twisting motions I've done a bit of|NA
00:02:43|00:02:46|research and there doesn't seem to be|NA
00:02:44|00:02:49|much literature around these ripples|NA
00:02:46|00:02:49|above an obstruction but I have found a|NA
00:02:49|00:02:52|clue|NA
00:02:49|00:02:54|and that cure is the Rayleigh plateau|NA
00:02:52|00:02:56|instability which is a fancy name for|NA
00:02:54|00:02:59|something you've probably seen many|NA
00:02:56|00:03:02|times before if you turn your tap down|NA
00:02:59|00:03:04|until it's just a fine stream eventually|NA
00:03:02|00:03:06|you'll see it breaking into droplets and|NA
00:03:04|00:03:09|that moment that it breaks into droplets|NA
00:03:06|00:03:10|that's Rayleigh plateau instability but|NA
00:03:09|00:03:12|the cool thing is if you take a|NA
00:03:10|00:03:13|freeze-frame of that happening it looks|NA
00:03:12|00:03:15|like this|NA
00:03:13|00:03:17|look at those ripples very similar to|NA
00:03:15|00:03:19|what we're getting here interesting|NA
00:03:17|00:03:21|application of the Rayleigh plateau|NA
00:03:19|00:03:23|instability is if you've got a jet of|NA
00:03:21|00:03:25|fluid hitting a surface and you want to|NA
00:03:23|00:03:28|reduce splash back simply reduce the|NA
00:03:25|00:03:32|distance to the surface until you remove|NA
00:03:28|00:03:33|all instability but why is it that you|NA
00:03:32|00:03:35|can only see those ripples in|NA
00:03:33|00:03:37|freeze-frame you can't see them with the|NA
00:03:35|00:03:38|naked eye it's because they're moving|NA
00:03:37|00:03:41|around they're moving up and down the|NA
00:03:38|00:03:44|stream as time goes on it's too fast for|NA
00:03:41|00:03:47|you to see so maybe when you're struck|NA
00:03:44|00:03:49|the flow of the stream you're generating|NA
00:03:47|00:03:51|the ripples at that point but you're|NA
00:03:49|00:03:54|fixing them in space somehow I've got a|NA
00:03:51|00:03:56|theory for how that might happen but|NA
00:03:54|00:03:58|where are the ripples come from in the|NA
00:03:56|00:04:00|first place in the Riley plateau|NA
00:03:58|00:04:03|instability well there is literature on|NA
00:04:00|00:04:04|that and it's all to do with surface|NA
00:04:03|00:04:07|tension you can think of the surface|NA
00:04:04|00:04:09|tension of water as like an elastic|NA
00:04:07|00:04:13|property that the water has on its|NA
00:04:09|00:04:14|surface so how's it gonna behave wait|NA
00:04:13|00:04:16|think about an elastic band mean you|NA
00:04:14|00:04:18|stretched an elastic band it pulls|NA
00:04:16|00:04:21|itself in an elastic band tries to|NA
00:04:18|00:04:23|minimize its length and it's similar|NA
00:04:21|00:04:27|with elastic surfaces they try to|NA
00:04:23|00:04:30|minimize their area and this is also|NA
00:04:27|00:04:30|true of soap film so when you blow a|NA
00:04:30|00:04:33|bubble|NA
00:04:30|00:04:36|it encapsulates a|NA
00:04:33|00:04:38|volume of air and it slowly kind of|NA
00:04:36|00:04:40|wobbles into its preferred shape which|NA
00:04:38|00:04:43|of course is a sphere because a sphere|NA
00:04:40|00:04:46|is the lowest surface area that can|NA
00:04:43|00:04:50|enclose a given volume and it's also why|NA
00:04:46|00:04:53|droplets of water forms spheres but what|NA
00:04:50|00:04:54|does this mean for a column of water|NA
00:04:53|00:04:57|like we have here well we can actually|NA
00:04:54|00:05:00|model it with soap film how does a|NA
00:04:57|00:05:03|cylindrical soap film minimize its|NA
00:05:00|00:05:05|surface area look as the sender grows in|NA
00:05:03|00:05:08|height the soap film starts to bow|NA
00:05:05|00:05:10|inwards this is always the minimum|NA
00:05:08|00:05:11|surface area if it was more pinched to|NA
00:05:10|00:05:13|the surface air would be greater if it|NA
00:05:11|00:05:16|was less pinched the surface air would|NA
00:05:13|00:05:19|be greater as well and as the cylinder|NA
00:05:16|00:05:22|grows in height that bowing inwards|NA
00:05:19|00:05:24|grows more pronounced anyway it gets to|NA
00:05:22|00:05:28|the point where it pinches all the way|NA
00:05:24|00:05:30|in and it separates into two separate|NA
00:05:28|00:05:32|soap films a bit like the formation of a|NA
00:05:30|00:05:35|droplet of water how does that apply to|NA
00:05:32|00:05:37|a column of water like why do the|NA
00:05:35|00:05:39|ripples appear in the particular|NA
00:05:37|00:05:43|location that they appear and why are|NA
00:05:39|00:05:46|they the size that they are well the|NA
00:05:43|00:05:49|ripples grow from tiny perturbations in|NA
00:05:46|00:05:52|the otherwise very smooth flow of water|NA
00:05:49|00:05:55|and they grow like this imagine that|NA
00:05:52|00:05:58|you've got some ripples that are kind of|NA
00:05:55|00:06:00|sinusoidal so you've got some pinch|NA
00:05:58|00:06:03|points and you've got some bulge points|NA
00:06:00|00:06:06|like this and here's an interesting fact|NA
00:06:03|00:06:10|about elastic surfaces if an elastic|NA
00:06:06|00:06:14|surface is tightly curved then the|NA
00:06:10|00:06:17|pressure inside will be great whereas if|NA
00:06:14|00:06:20|the elastic surface is loosely curved|NA
00:06:17|00:06:24|the pressure inside will be less and you|NA
00:06:20|00:06:26|can apply that to these bulges here so|NA
00:06:24|00:06:29|look at the neck here you've got a tight|NA
00:06:26|00:06:31|lid curved elastic surface so the|NA
00:06:29|00:06:33|pressure inside is very great at the|NA
00:06:31|00:06:35|Bulge you've got a loosely curved|NA
00:06:33|00:06:37|surface so the pressure is less that|NA
00:06:35|00:06:39|means that the neck will squeeze water|NA
00:06:37|00:06:42|into the Bulge and you will have this|NA
00:06:39|00:06:43|growing ripple except it's a little bit|NA
00:06:42|00:06:47|more complicated|NA
00:06:43|00:06:50|that because the curvature at the pinch|NA
00:06:47|00:06:52|points it's actually a saddle point and|NA
00:06:50|00:06:55|saddle points are a bit more complicated|NA
00:06:52|00:06:56|a good example of saddle point is a|NA
00:06:55|00:06:57|Pringle crisp so you've got a curve|NA
00:06:56|00:06:59|going this way|NA
00:06:57|00:07:01|and you've got a curve going that way|NA
00:06:59|00:07:03|like it like a saddle essentially but|NA
00:07:01|00:07:06|look imagine that this is a little|NA
00:07:03|00:07:09|section of our pinch point you've got|NA
00:07:06|00:07:10|the inside curve here that's generating|NA
00:07:09|00:07:12|pressure inside but then you've got this|NA
00:07:10|00:07:15|this is actually a negative curve it's|NA
00:07:12|00:07:18|going the other way so it's reducing the|NA
00:07:15|00:07:20|pressure inside the neck so it's|NA
00:07:18|00:07:23|actually not clear who's gonna win the|NA
00:07:20|00:07:25|fight is it the the Bulge that has like|NA
00:07:23|00:07:26|both curves of the curve in this|NA
00:07:25|00:07:27|direction the curve in this direction|NA
00:07:26|00:07:30|they're both adding to the pressure|NA
00:07:27|00:07:31|inside but look at this curve here this|NA
00:07:30|00:07:34|curve is going the other way it's a|NA
00:07:31|00:07:36|negative curvature and it actually|NA
00:07:34|00:07:39|reduces the pressure inside so there's a|NA
00:07:36|00:07:41|balance between those two effects and it|NA
00:07:39|00:07:45|turns out that who wins the fight|NA
00:07:41|00:07:48|depends on the wavelength of the ripples|NA
00:07:45|00:07:50|so with those short wavelength ripples|NA
00:07:48|00:07:52|that the Bulge is gonna win the fight|NA
00:07:50|00:07:56|and they're just going to disappear but|NA
00:07:52|00:07:59|with longer curvature ripples where the|NA
00:07:56|00:08:03|external curvature is lower then the the|NA
00:07:59|00:08:04|pressure inside the neck is going to win|NA
00:08:03|00:08:05|and the pinch point is going to get|NA
00:08:04|00:08:08|greater and greater|NA
00:08:05|00:08:10|it's those bulges that are going to grow|NA
00:08:08|00:08:15|it's that optimum wavelength that you're|NA
00:08:10|00:08:17|ultimately going to see so there's got|NA
00:08:15|00:08:19|to be a link between this Rayleigh|NA
00:08:17|00:08:21|plateau instability and the ripples that|NA
00:08:19|00:08:23|we're seeing when we all struct the|NA
00:08:21|00:08:25|stream of water my thinking is this when|NA
00:08:23|00:08:28|you put your finger into the stream|NA
00:08:25|00:08:31|you're forcing the water to bow out at|NA
00:08:28|00:08:33|that fixed point and it's a bit like a|NA
00:08:31|00:08:36|standing wave in wave mechanics so|NA
00:08:33|00:08:38|you've got a kind of boundary condition|NA
00:08:36|00:08:40|so in wave mechanics a boundary|NA
00:08:38|00:08:42|condition is when you fix a certain|NA
00:08:40|00:08:43|point like on a guitar string one end is|NA
00:08:42|00:08:45|fixed as you've got two boundary|NA
00:08:43|00:08:48|conditions both ends are fixed and that|NA
00:08:45|00:08:51|forces a standing wave in the vibrations|NA
00:08:48|00:08:54|of the guitar string and in a similar|NA
00:08:51|00:08:55|sense here you're saying look we're|NA
00:08:54|00:08:59|forcing an ant|NA
00:08:55|00:09:02|at this point and the rest of the wave|NA
00:08:59|00:09:04|is gonna grow upwards from that point|NA
00:09:02|00:09:05|like a standing wave on a guitar string|NA
00:09:04|00:09:07|that's my theory anyway|NA
00:09:05|00:09:09|I love investigating these sorts of|NA
00:09:07|00:09:11|things just for their own sake really|NA
00:09:09|00:09:13|like I'm sure nothing useful will ever|NA
00:09:11|00:09:15|come of it but I actually think|NA
00:09:13|00:09:17|curiosity for curiosity's sake is|NA
00:09:15|00:09:18|important because some of these|NA
00:09:17|00:09:20|investigations do turn out to be|NA
00:09:18|00:09:24|important like the Raley Plateau|NA
00:09:20|00:09:26|instability is really useful for making|NA
00:09:24|00:09:28|printers work like inkjet printers and|NA
00:09:26|00:09:32|all sorts of other applications actually|NA
00:09:28|00:09:34|bizarrely even black holes like some|NA
00:09:32|00:09:37|physicists are investigating what black|NA
00:09:34|00:09:39|holes look like in the extra dimensions|NA
00:09:37|00:09:42|of string theory and they're modeling it|NA
00:09:39|00:09:44|as what they call black strings and it|NA
00:09:42|00:09:46|seems like these black strings are|NA
00:09:44|00:09:49|unstable in a similar way to streams of|NA
00:09:46|00:09:52|water and they're gonna break up into|NA
00:09:49|00:09:54|like black hole droplets like the|NA
00:09:52|00:09:55|Rayleigh plateau droplets really|NA
00:09:54|00:09:58|interesting stuff this video is|NA
00:09:55|00:10:00|sponsored by Squarespace as you know I'm|NA
00:09:58|00:10:03|working with my dad on a project to|NA
00:10:00|00:10:05|publish his articles online he writes|NA

00:01:34|00:01:35|"-You're like, ""I wouldn't wear that."""|NA

00:01:44|00:01:46|What did you bring to scare me with tonight?|NA
00:01:46|00:01:48|-All right. So, first up, we have Jane.|NA
00:01:48|00:01:50|-Is that a man? Oh, no, okay, okay.|NA
00:01:50|00:01:52|-And Jane... -Okay. Oh, no, no, no.|NA
00:01:52|00:01:54|-...is a dictator scorpion.|NA
00:01:54|00:01:56|-See? Nah, nah, nah. -And Jane is absolutely amazing.|NA
00:01:56|00:01:58|And you're welcome to come close.|NA
00:01:58|00:02:00|She's very calm. She's really nice.|NA
00:02:00|00:02:02|She's actually quite friendly.|NA
00:02:02|00:02:04|-No, that's impossible. It's a scorpion.|NA
00:02:04|00:02:06|How could a scorpion be friendly?|NA
00:02:06|00:02:08|Well, she's curling her tail. That means something, right?|NA
00:02:08|00:02:10|-Yeah. Well, that tail actually contains her venom.|NA
00:02:10|00:02:12|She's got quite a bit of venom.|NA
00:02:12|00:02:16|And they actually inject that venom to kill their prey.|NA
00:02:16|00:02:17|And isn't she just magnificent?|NA
00:02:17|00:02:19|-She's curling it up. She's getting it --|NA
00:02:19|00:02:20|She's, like, balling her fist, ready to go.|NA
00:02:20|00:02:22|-Yeah, but if you look closely,|NA
00:02:22|00:02:24|see those little hairs along her little little pinchers?|NA
00:02:24|00:02:25|-Yeah. -And it's interesting|NA
00:02:25|00:02:28|'cause the bigger the pinchers, the less venomous they are,|NA
00:02:28|00:02:30|but if they have smaller pinchers,|NA
00:02:30|00:02:32|that means they pack a lot of venom.|NA
00:02:32|00:02:34|[ Laughs ] It's pretty interesting, isn't it?|NA
00:02:34|00:02:36|-I don't know how you're that calm. I mean, it's real, right?|NA
00:02:36|00:02:38|That's really moving. I don't like that.|NA
00:02:38|00:02:39|-Yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely. -That thing frightens me.|NA
00:02:39|00:02:41|-Absolutely. -They're so cool.|NA
00:02:41|00:02:42|They're actually nocturnal, as well.|NA
00:02:42|00:02:43|-They hunt at night. -Oh, perfect.|NA
00:02:43|00:02:45|-Yeah. -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.|NA
00:02:45|00:02:47|I run into that thing at night.|NA
00:02:47|00:02:48|Get this thing out of here, please.|NA
00:02:48|00:02:50|-It's beautiful. -Okay. No worries.|NA
00:02:50|00:02:51|-Thank you. What a beautiful creature.|NA
00:02:51|00:02:53|-Yeah, they're gorgeous.|NA
00:02:53|00:02:55|Thank you.|NA
00:02:55|00:02:57|-Ahh. Don't you have anything cute?|NA
00:02:57|00:02:59|-Well, this -- this animal is a little bit more cute.|NA
00:02:59|00:03:01|So, how about you come around in front of the desk?|NA
00:03:01|00:03:03|-Okay. Okay. -All right. Okay.|NA
00:03:03|00:03:05|So, let's bring out our next animal.|NA
00:03:05|00:03:07|-I want you to sit down. -Okay.|NA
00:03:07|00:03:09|-All right. Ready? -Yeah.|NA
00:03:09|00:03:12|These -- [ Laughs ] These are baby black bears.|NA
00:03:12|00:03:15|-Oh, my God. -Aren't they beautiful?|NA
00:03:15|00:03:17|Oh, don't -- don't -- don't do that.|NA
00:03:17|00:03:19|-Don't do that. -Ah! Ooh! Ow!|NA
00:03:19|00:03:21|-You can -- You can let -- You can let him go.|NA
00:03:21|00:03:22|You can let her go. There you go.|NA
00:03:22|00:03:23|-All right. This is a baby bear?|NA
00:03:23|00:03:25|-I think she's kind of just chewing on --|NA
00:03:25|00:03:26|She's chewing on your thumb a little bit.|NA
00:03:26|00:03:28|-Yeah, she definitely was chewing on my thumb.|NA
00:03:28|00:03:30|-Absolutely. -They're so funny.|NA
00:03:30|00:03:33|So, these baby bears are kind of hyperactive when they're little.|NA
00:03:33|00:03:35|They love exploring. -How old are they?|NA
00:03:35|00:03:37|-Well, these ones actually are only a couple months old.|NA
00:03:37|00:03:40|They will get quite a bit larger than this, though.|NA
00:03:40|00:03:42|Oh, sorry, sorry. Sorry about that.|NA
00:03:42|00:03:44|-Let's not get them angry. Yeah, yeah.|NA
00:03:44|00:03:45|-They're really special.|NA
00:03:45|00:03:47|Now, these guys are actually omnivores.|NA
00:03:47|00:03:50|So they'll eat meat, and they'll also eat vegetables.|NA
00:03:50|00:03:52|-[ Laughs ] -Don't chew on the wire.|NA
00:03:52|00:03:55|-No, don't chew that. -Do they eat -- No.|NA
00:03:55|00:03:57|They're omnivores, so they eat both vegetables|NA
00:03:57|00:03:59|-and meat, as well? -Yeah, yeah, they do.|NA
00:03:59|00:04:02|They love flowers and little berries and things like that.|NA
00:04:02|00:04:05|-No, don't do -- -He's very cute.|NA
00:04:05|00:04:07|How big will they get?|NA
00:04:07|00:04:08|-Well, this one could actually get|NA
00:04:08|00:04:10|maybe up to about 300 pounds.|NA
00:04:10|00:04:12|So they can get quite large.|NA
00:04:12|00:04:14|-Please remember me, okay? Please. Yeah.|NA
00:04:14|00:04:16|When you get older. Oh, that is fantastic.|NA

00:04:21|00:04:24|-This one is -- [ Laughs ] This one is D-9.|NA

00:04:28|00:04:30|-D-9. Oh, hi, D-9. -Yeah.|NA
00:04:30|00:04:32|-All right. And what's this guy's name?|NA
00:04:32|00:04:34|-And, so, this one here -- No, don't chew Jimmy.|NA
00:04:34|00:04:36|-It's all right. It's okay.|NA
00:04:36|00:04:38|-All she wants to do is just chew you.|NA
00:04:38|00:04:40|-Aww. -And this one is Flo.|NA
00:04:40|00:04:43|Flo is really cute. She's got a great name.|NA
00:04:43|00:04:45|[ Laughs ] Oh, aren't they gorgeous?|NA
00:04:45|00:04:48|-That was the closest I ever came to a bear. This is so cool.|NA
00:04:48|00:04:50|All right. I'm going to -- Yeah, I want to --|NA
00:04:50|00:04:52|-So, do you want to -- -I survived this.|NA
00:04:52|00:04:53|So I'm happy about this. -All right, okay, okay.|NA
00:04:53|00:04:56|I think it's time for you guys to head off.|NA
00:04:56|00:04:58|-Bye, guys. Thank you. -What nice bears.|NA

00:05:11|00:05:13|I love the cute animals. -Yeah, well, next up,|NA
00:05:13|00:05:14|we -- we -- [ Laughs ]|NA
00:05:14|00:05:16|We have another cute animal for you.|NA
00:05:16|00:05:17|-Okay, good.|NA
00:05:17|00:05:19|-And they have very cute names, as well.|NA
00:05:19|00:05:21|-This is Lulu and Fluffy. -Fluffy and Lulu, good.|NA
00:05:21|00:05:22|-Now, the -- I know what you're thinking. They're not snakes.|NA
00:05:22|00:05:24|Don't worry. They're -- They're all good.|NA
00:05:24|00:05:26|They're actually legless lizards.|NA
00:05:26|00:05:28|So, these legless lizards --|NA
00:05:28|00:05:30|-That's not Lulu and Fluffy at all.|NA
00:05:30|00:05:32|-Yeah, Lulu and Fluffy. -I think that's D-9.|NA
00:05:32|00:05:33|-You want to hold Fluffy? -Oh, my gosh.|NA
00:05:33|00:05:35|-You're welcome to hold him. He loves being held.|NA
00:05:35|00:05:37|-I really don't want to hold these things.|NA
00:05:37|00:05:39|-There you go. Oh, good job! -Oh, gosh!|NA
00:05:39|00:05:41|What are these things? They're not -- They're snakes.|NA
00:05:41|00:05:43|-No, they're legless lizards. [ Laughter ]|NA
00:05:43|00:05:45|And you can tell the difference...|NA

00:05:49|00:05:50|You can tell the difference --|NA
00:05:50|00:05:52|-Legless lizards? This one's not moving.|NA
00:05:52|00:05:54|-You can see those little ears there.|NA
00:05:54|00:05:57|He actually has ears. Snakes don't have ears.|NA
00:05:57|00:05:59|So that's one of the biggest reasons why --|NA
00:05:59|00:06:00|how you can actually tell the difference.|NA
00:06:00|00:06:02|They're really special.|NA
00:06:02|00:06:03|-He -- Why -- It feels like he's gonna strike or something.|NA
00:06:03|00:06:06|Why is he staring at me? -He won't strike. It's all good.|NA
00:06:06|00:06:08|I think he's just trying to work out what you're doing.|NA
00:06:08|00:06:09|It's okay. You'll be fine.|NA
00:06:09|00:06:10|-What -- What should I be doing? -Uh.|NA
00:06:10|00:06:11|[ Laughter ]|NA
00:06:11|00:06:12|-What -- I mean, I'm holding him.|NA

00:00:11|00:00:16|in our universe when you change from a|NA

00:00:16|00:00:20|or vice versa that change of perspective|NA
00:00:18|00:00:21|is represented by what's called a|NA

00:00:30|00:00:34|since that's the way our universe works|NA
00:00:32|00:00:35|for example let's say I'm not moving|NA
00:00:34|00:00:37|that is I'm at the same position at all|NA
00:00:35|00:00:39|times and you're moving 1/3 the speed of|NA
00:00:37|00:00:41|light to my right and you turn on a|NA
00:00:39|00:00:43|flashlight then that light will move at|NA
00:00:41|00:00:45|the speed of light C or about 300|NA

00:00:49|00:00:51|you're not moving|NA

00:01:07|00:01:10|almost more like what happens when you|NA

00:01:20|00:01:24|light to the right relative to you how|NA
00:01:22|00:01:26|fast is it going from my perspective the|NA
00:01:24|00:01:28|intuitive answer to this question is|NA
00:01:26|00:01:29|that if the death pellet is going 180|NA

00:01:33|00:01:37|relative to me then the death pellet|NA
00:01:35|00:01:38|must be going 360 million meters per|NA
00:01:37|00:01:41|second to the right relative to me which|NA

00:01:43|00:01:47|add up when you change perspective they|NA

00:02:30|00:02:33|going sixty percent the speed of light|NA
00:02:32|00:02:35|is kind of reaching the limits of what|NA

00:02:35|00:02:38|display if you shoot a death pellet at|NA
00:02:36|00:02:39|60 percent the speed of light and then|NA
00:02:38|00:02:41|we shift to my perspective from which|NA
00:02:39|00:02:43|you're going 60 percent the speed of|NA
00:02:41|00:02:45|light the death pellet still isn't going|NA

00:02:48|00:02:52|percent the speed of light from a death|NA
00:02:50|00:02:53|pellet going 60 percent the speed of|NA
00:02:52|00:02:56|light and so on the final speed would be|NA
00:02:53|00:02:57|close to but not quite the speed of|NA
00:02:56|00:03:00|light because of how relative velocities|NA

00:03:07|00:03:11|then changes of moving perspective can|NA
00:03:10|00:03:13|never make other velocities changed from|NA
00:03:11|00:03:15|a relative speed less than the speed of|NA
00:03:13|00:03:17|light to a relative speed equal to or|NA

00:03:17|00:03:21|moving at a speed V relative to your|NA

00:03:21|00:03:25|to me with speed U then the equation|NA

00:03:25|00:03:29|object is moving relative to my|NA

00:03:34|00:03:38|perspective times u over C squared where|NA
00:03:36|00:03:40|C is the speed of light you'll notice|NA
00:03:38|00:03:41|that if you put the speed of light in as|NA

00:03:41|00:03:45|always gives the speed of light back no|NA

00:03:52|00:03:55|always gives back an answer less than|NA
00:03:54|00:03:57|the speed of light which is what we were|NA
00:03:55|00:03:59|describing earlier about relative speeds|NA
00:03:57|00:04:00|never adding up to a speed faster than|NA
00:03:59|00:04:03|light and you'll notice that if both|NA
00:04:00|00:04:05|velocities are a lot lot smaller than|NA
00:04:03|00:04:06|the speed of light then the V times u|NA
00:04:05|00:04:08|divided by C squared term in the bottom|NA
00:04:06|00:04:11|is essentially zero and so the whole|NA

00:02:21|00:02:27|want to give me a hand with this oh so|A
00:02:24|00:02:30|ha let's go ahead and I'm gonna tip it|A
00:02:27|00:02:33|your way so we're gonna put the stand on|A
00:02:30|00:02:37|with it upside down okay do you want to|A
00:02:33|00:02:40|grab that screwdriver it's okay I got|A
00:02:37|00:02:48|this you can you can trust me he thinks|A
00:02:40|00:02:51|I might drop it gotta say the packing|A
00:02:48|00:02:53|for this is definitely more rudimentary|A
00:02:51|00:02:55|I think this is like a demo unit for|A
00:02:53|00:02:57|sending to potential commercial|A
00:02:55|00:02:58|customers or something|A
00:02:57|00:03:01|there's no I don't even think there was|A
00:02:58|00:03:03|a remote in the box it's a really clean|A
00:03:01|00:03:05|looking TV very little branding got your|A
00:03:03|00:03:09|Sharp logo over here ah quotes and then|A
00:03:05|00:03:14|you've just got eight k76 80 by 40 320|A
00:03:09|00:03:14|pixels baby okay here we go|A
00:03:17|00:03:23|now these HDMI cables are nothing|A
00:03:20|00:03:26|special but theoretically each one of|A
00:03:23|00:03:30|them is only carrying a 4k 60 signal|A
00:03:26|00:03:33|which should be fine just fine except|A
00:03:30|00:03:35|for one small problem no modern graphics|A
00:03:33|00:03:40|card contains more than usually one or|A
00:03:35|00:03:41|two HDMI connections now we tried a|A
00:03:40|00:03:44|solution a little while ago where we|A
00:03:41|00:03:48|used for graphics cards in a Quadro|A
00:03:44|00:03:51|mosaic display thing to drive quadrants|A
00:03:48|00:03:53|of a monitor it didn't work at all it|A
00:03:51|00:03:56|was super stupid performance sucked but|A
00:03:53|00:03:58|fortunately adapters to the rescue so|A
00:03:56|00:04:02|these are active|A
00:03:58|00:04:05|DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 adapters that I|A
00:04:02|00:04:07|acquired for that failed project and I|A
00:04:05|00:04:10|am hoping to finally see some success|A
00:04:07|00:04:18|with today so we're gonna get these bad|A
00:04:10|00:04:21|boys plugged in oh wait oh I had this|A
00:04:18|00:04:24|totally wrong before so when I pointed|A
00:04:21|00:04:27|at the HDMI ports before that was|A
00:04:24|00:04:29|completely wrong the HDMI ports I wanted|A
00:04:27|00:04:33|were down here so these are all just|A
00:04:29|00:04:38|individual normal HDMI ports this is a|A
00:04:33|00:04:40|single input input seven 8k signal input|A
00:04:38|00:04:43|and it's got like cable management clips|A
00:04:40|00:04:46|for and all that shiz so just like that|A
00:04:43|00:04:47|experiment with each separate graphics|A
00:04:46|00:04:51|card running a different quadrant of the|A
00:04:47|00:04:54|display this display does split input|A
00:04:51|00:04:56|seven into quadrants but unlike that one|A
00:04:54|00:04:58|we're using a single graphics card with|A
00:04:56|00:05:01|its single frame buffer in order to|A
00:04:58|00:05:03|drive all four quadrants or rather I|A
00:05:01|00:05:05|should say we're using two in SLI but|A
00:05:03|00:05:07|they're all hooked up to a single one so|A
00:05:05|00:05:09|we don't need any kind of external|A
00:05:07|00:05:12|synchronization card or anything like|A
00:05:09|00:05:15|that it thought should theoretically|A
00:05:12|00:05:19|just work believe it or not this is how|A
00:05:15|00:05:21|they usually run like future panel|A
00:05:19|00:05:24|technology demos at trade shows like CES|A
00:05:21|00:05:26|except instead of actually building them|A
00:05:24|00:05:29|into a real commercialized product they|A
00:05:26|00:05:31|just do it on like a crazy hand soldered|A
00:05:29|00:05:37|thing that sits under the curtain that|A
00:05:31|00:05:39|looks great I'm like feeling the what is|A
00:05:37|00:05:42|it what was it Mac sell or something|A
00:05:39|00:05:46|Memorex but you know that classic|A
00:05:42|00:05:49|commercial but now take KK me no signal|A
00:05:46|00:05:54|from external device hey bottom right|A
00:05:49|00:05:57|grab the signal holy it's on the whole|A
00:05:54|00:06:00|display now hold on a minute|A
00:05:57|00:06:03|no way there's no way it's gonna just|A
00:06:00|00:06:05|run a ke effortlessly okay one of them|A
00:06:03|00:06:08|is running at 50 Hertz why would that be|A
00:06:05|00:06:10|and how would that work that's bizarre|A
00:06:08|00:06:12|why would anyone want that one running|A
00:06:10|00:06:13|at 50 and the others running at 60 okay|A
00:06:12|00:06:16|let's have it|A
00:06:13|00:06:17|let's have a quick boo here so we need|A
00:06:16|00:06:21|to grab some games we're gonna get that|A
00:06:17|00:06:22|going but in the meantime know this did|A
00:06:21|00:06:25|not quite work perfectly out of the box|A
00:06:22|00:06:27|and I do think we have a little bit of|A
00:06:25|00:06:29|configuration to do so let's start by|A
00:06:27|00:06:30|figuring out which one of these is|A
00:06:29|00:06:33|broken|A
00:06:30|00:06:37|I suspect the one that's running at 50|A
00:06:33|00:06:44|Hertz but only one way to find out for|A
00:06:37|00:06:47|oh man that wasn't it oh boy oh boy okay|A
00:06:44|00:06:57|maybe just enter will do it no of course|A
00:06:47|00:06:58|not did it oh boy what is Oh he's dead|A
00:06:57|00:07:01|Jim|A
00:06:58|00:07:04|this isn't even working in the BIOS now|A
00:07:01|00:07:07|this is more broken than it was when we|A
00:07:04|00:07:10|started I have a way of creating hassle|A
00:07:07|00:07:12|where no hassle existed before okay so|A
00:07:10|00:07:16|it's running but still not correctly|A
00:07:12|00:07:18|however before we move forward I've got|A
00:07:16|00:07:21|a bit of an update for you guys as it|A
00:07:18|00:07:24|turns out at least one of the problems|A
00:07:21|00:07:28|we had was caused by invidious seemingly|A
00:07:24|00:07:31|arbitrary limitation on their consumer|A
00:07:28|00:07:33|graphics cards that only allows you to|A
00:07:31|00:07:38|set up an end the surround configuration|A
00:07:33|00:07:44|with a maximum of three displays so this|A
00:07:38|00:07:47|system is out and my test bench is in so|A
00:07:44|00:07:49|we've hooked this up with 2gb 100 Quadro|A
00:07:47|00:07:52|graphics cards these have 32 gigs of ram|A
00:07:49|00:07:55|over 5,000 cuda cores in terms of their|A
00:07:52|00:07:59|gaming performance they shouldn't be|A
00:07:55|00:08:01|that far off something like an RT X 2080|A
00:07:59|00:08:02|I mean they're not quite there but|A
00:08:01|00:08:05|they're certainly closer to that than|A
00:08:02|00:08:06|they are to attend a DTI then we ran|A
00:08:05|00:08:08|into another problem remember how I had|A
00:08:06|00:08:11|three of these DisplayPort to HDMI|A
00:08:08|00:08:14|adapter z' well these cards only have|A
00:08:11|00:08:17|DisplayPort outputs so I had to use|A
00:08:14|00:08:19|DisplayPort to DVI DVI to HDMI and then|A
00:08:17|00:08:23|that to the TV so while we are actually|A
00:08:19|00:08:25|running an Nvidia mosaic configuration|A
00:08:23|00:08:27|here and we can see that if we pull up|A
00:08:25|00:08:30|the Nvidia control panel and|A
00:08:27|00:08:32|theoretically when we go to manage GPU|A
00:08:30|00:08:38|utilization here we're running an SLI|A
00:08:32|00:08:40|but the SLI menu item went away once we|A
00:08:38|00:08:42|configured mosaic and it doesn't appear|A
00:08:40|00:08:45|that our second GPU is actually doing|A
00:08:42|00:08:47|anything for now this is what we're|A
00:08:45|00:08:52|stuck with though and damn it I want to|A
00:08:47|00:08:55|see 8k so we've got another one of these|A
00:08:52|00:08:58|DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and you guys|A
00:08:55|00:09:03|are coming with me for the ride of even|A
00:08:58|00:09:04|if the performance sucks finally getting|A
00:09:03|00:09:09|an 8k output here|A
00:09:04|00:09:11|all right once these are numbered oh I|A
00:09:09|00:09:13|see that's a new one I have literally|A
00:09:11|00:09:16|never seen it do that before|A
00:09:13|00:09:19|okay sure why not remember windows 95|A
00:09:16|00:09:21|guys remember you know who I really feel|A
00:09:19|00:09:24|bad for and all this is sharp they reach|A
00:09:21|00:09:25|out to go yeah you really shouldn't have|A
00:09:24|00:09:28|to jump through a bunch of stupid hoops|A
00:09:25|00:09:30|to get 8k 60 Hertz going on a PC and as|A
00:09:28|00:09:33|far as I can tell none of this is their|A
00:09:30|00:09:35|fault but this is an awful lot of stupid|A
00:09:33|00:09:38|hoops okay so I know set up multiple|A
00:09:35|00:09:39|displays is not the mosaic configuration|A
00:09:38|00:09:42|thing but the reason that I set all this|A
00:09:39|00:09:45|up correctly was that I was hoping that|A
00:09:42|00:09:48|now when we go to set up mosaic it'll|A
00:09:45|00:09:52|kind of grab that everything is the way|A
00:09:48|00:09:53|it's supposed to be and it'll work come|A
00:09:52|00:09:56|on|A
00:09:53|00:10:03|okay well it's letting me click Next and|A
00:09:56|00:10:06|that's correct okay let's try the other|A
00:10:03|00:10:08|graphics card I don't know I did notice|A
00:10:06|00:10:09|that even though we're plugged into the|A
00:10:08|00:10:10|one that would normally be in the|A
00:10:09|00:10:14|primary slot on the motherboard it's|A
00:10:10|00:10:17|identifying as GPU - so who knows maybe|A
00:10:14|00:10:17|this will help|A
00:10:21|00:10:27|there's more lunch frankly I'm pretty|A
00:10:25|00:10:28|close to the end of my rope I was doing|A
00:10:27|00:10:33|some off-screen troubleshooting|A
00:10:28|00:10:37|involving trying older Quadros so GP|A
00:10:33|00:10:40|100's instead of the GV 100's I did a|A
00:10:37|00:10:43|full platform swap and so motherboard|A
00:10:40|00:10:47|CPU change them out just meowed but I|A
00:10:43|00:10:51|don't know and it's always the same|A
00:10:47|00:10:53|thing I click apply it goes little bit|A
00:10:51|00:10:58|little bit yet and then there's no|A
00:10:53|00:11:02|finish but I do not accept that|A
00:10:58|00:11:09|conclusion and I have decided to try one|A
00:11:02|00:11:12|last thing we're gonna go AMD ok so|A
00:11:09|00:11:16|according to this community post it's|A
00:11:12|00:11:16|possible but I think I know why it might|A
00:11:16|00:11:20|not be where|A
00:11:16|00:11:24|okay I think it might just be grabbing|A
00:11:20|00:11:28|my configuration from Windows and then|A
00:11:24|00:11:30|assuming that I want a four by one okay|A
00:11:28|00:11:32|your display configuration has been|A
00:11:30|00:11:39|updated re-enable Eyefinity display|A
00:11:32|00:11:41|group know why the fact that it's rien a|A
00:11:39|00:11:43|below is what's tripping me out here I|A
00:11:41|00:11:45|don't want to re-enable it|A
00:11:43|00:11:47|I want to enable a new different one|A
00:11:45|00:11:49|that is not like what I had before I|A
00:11:47|00:11:51|don't know how to start fresh when I|A
00:11:49|00:11:57|disable it and it only prompts me to|A
00:11:51|00:12:02|re-enable it just AMD things easy|A
00:11:57|00:12:04|Nvidia things oh it's not working to be|A
00:12:02|00:12:07|clear neither of them is giving me a|A
00:12:04|00:12:09|working 60 Hertz a katehis way well|A
00:12:07|00:12:11|other than the boneheaded driver|A
00:12:09|00:12:13|limitation that doesn't allow me to|A
00:12:11|00:12:15|arrange it in a 2x2 this was a much|A
00:12:13|00:12:17|better experience but due to the|A
00:12:15|00:12:19|boneheaded driver implementation that|A
00:12:17|00:12:20|doesn't let me arrange it in a 2x2 I|A
00:12:19|00:12:23|guess we're going back to our next best|A
00:12:20|00:12:26|lead which is Quadro to see if maybe we|A
00:12:23|00:12:28|can get that to work it's been a few|A
00:12:26|00:12:34|more hours and a lifeline has arrived we|A
00:12:28|00:12:38|now have Oh No if they only shipped two|A
00:12:34|00:12:42|I'm gonna be so upset on two|A
00:12:38|00:12:44|no there's four okay the good news|A
00:12:42|00:12:48|though I also reached out to sharp and I|A
00:12:44|00:12:49|was like what tables did you guys use to|A
00:12:48|00:12:52|get this working because they assured me|A
00:12:49|00:12:57|it would be no problem piece of cake|A
00:12:52|00:13:02|piece of crumb cake and they said they|A
00:12:57|00:13:06|got these cables from PC cable world I|A
00:13:02|00:13:09|guess so these are DisplayPort to HDMI|A
00:13:06|00:13:13|cables rather than adapters|A
00:13:09|00:13:15|theoretically that is exactly the same|A
00:13:13|00:13:15|thing|A
00:13:15|00:13:20|at this point I don't know if I know|A
00:13:18|00:13:26|anything anymore if this doesn't work|A
00:13:20|00:13:36|I'm officially stumped here we go one|A
00:13:26|00:13:39|two Wow okay that did grab 4k 60 Hertz|A
00:13:36|00:13:41|on all four of them really fast you have|A
00:13:39|00:13:45|got to be kidding me|A
00:13:41|00:13:45|[Laughter]|A
00:13:50|00:14:03|so after all that I we could do four|A
00:13:58|00:14:06|times 4k but heaven forbid we want to|A
00:14:03|00:14:10|run them in mosaic on Nvidia with|A
00:14:06|00:14:15|adapters on AMD we could do four by one|A
00:14:10|00:14:20|at 4k but heaven forbid we want to|A
00:14:15|00:14:22|rearrange them like this wait what like|A
00:14:20|00:14:25|stop stop don't do it like whatever|A
00:14:22|00:14:26|you're changing now control panel stop|A
00:14:25|00:14:29|changing it because everything is|A
00:14:26|00:14:32|working this is right stop stop changing|A
00:14:29|00:14:35|things finish finish how could I just|A
00:14:32|00:14:37|could I just kill the task I wonder if I|A
00:14:35|00:14:43|can just kill the task Nvidia control|A
00:14:37|00:14:48|panel and task it worked 100% scaling|A
00:14:43|00:14:56|show me that native a K baby Wow|A
00:14:48|00:14:58|60 Hertz a K there it is launching a No|A
00:14:56|00:15:01|so what eight K max draw distance the|A
00:14:58|00:15:03|game wouldn't even launch but we've got|A
00:15:01|00:15:06|it at full medium 8k but there's bad|A
00:15:03|00:15:10|news too it drops to 30 frames per|A
00:15:06|00:15:13|second in the menu when it sits at 60 at|A
00:15:10|00:15:18|the main menu this does not bode well|A
00:15:13|00:15:21|for performance wow this is so like|A
00:15:18|00:15:23|disorienting sitting this close to the|A
00:15:21|00:15:27|city one of the issues with this game's|A
00:15:23|00:15:27|interface in general|A
00:15:27|00:15:32|and we're back so one of the problems|A
00:15:31|00:15:34|that I have with this game in general is|A
00:15:32|00:15:37|that you can't zoom the interface out|A
00:15:34|00:15:39|far enough and I especially feel it like|A
00:15:37|00:15:43|this cuz sitting this close to it|A
00:15:39|00:15:45|honestly is very comfortable in terms of|A
00:15:43|00:15:47|the detail of the game like even at the|A
00:15:45|00:15:50|maxim level let's go ahead and find one|A
00:15:47|00:15:55|of our wood cutters again here this guy|A
00:15:50|00:15:56|walking is cow that is unfreaking|A
00:15:55|00:15:59|believable I don't even have|A
00:15:56|00:16:01|anti-aliasing on I have zero|A
00:15:59|00:16:05|anti-aliasing on right now can you|A
00:16:01|00:16:10|believe that Renan will not look nuts|A
00:16:05|00:16:12|and that's crazy I love it so that was|A
00:16:10|00:16:15|it for a no now we're firing up shadow|A
00:16:12|00:16:18|of the Tomb Raider to see how a like a|A
00:16:15|00:16:21|third-person adventure game feels at 8k|A
00:16:18|00:16:24|so far pretty good I mean it's obviously|A
00:16:21|00:16:27|not running great we're looking at about|A
00:16:24|00:16:29|7 to 20 fps in menu and that's reported|A
00:16:27|00:16:34|by fraps that's clearly not even|A
00:16:29|00:16:39|accurate wow the hair and this is with|A
00:16:34|00:16:42|no anti-aliasing is incredible huh|A
00:16:39|00:16:45|actually in motion it's not nearly as|A
00:16:42|00:16:48|convincing part of that could be the 19|A
00:16:45|00:16:50|frame per second performance though you|A
00:16:48|00:16:52|know say what you will about Nvidia r-tx|A
00:16:50|00:16:55|and the performance impact and all that|A
00:16:52|00:16:58|but you've got our respect Nvidia for|A
00:16:55|00:17:02|recognizing that resolution is no longer|A
00:16:58|00:17:04|the biggest bottleneck in gaming image|A
00:17:02|00:17:06|quality and just trying something|A
00:17:04|00:17:10|anything else because sitting at a|A
00:17:06|00:17:14|reasonable distance like yeah that looks|A
00:17:10|00:17:17|crisp AF but is it really that much|A
00:17:14|00:17:17|better than 4k|A
00:17:18|00:17:24|that does look real sharp though pardon|A
00:17:21|00:17:26|the pun so there you go guys about 15|A
00:17:24|00:17:32|grand worth of graphics horsepower we're|A
00:17:26|00:17:34|looking at 20 FPS average pretty thick|A
00:17:32|00:17:36|let's see how many FPS we get in rocket|A
00:17:34|00:17:40|League hey Riley you want to play rocket|A
00:17:36|00:17:45|League for me help me Riley play at 8k|A
00:17:40|00:17:48|whoa it's an 8k yeah it's a keyboard|A
00:17:45|00:17:50|working hold on there you go there you|A
00:17:48|00:17:52|go whoa|A
00:17:50|00:17:56|like it's one thing being this close to|A
00:17:52|00:17:59|like a huge TV like this but it is like|A
00:17:56|00:18:03|actually sharp oh yeah is it a sharp TV|A
00:17:59|00:18:05|yeah like everything down to the treadle|A
00:18:03|00:18:07|like you can really tell that the the|A
00:18:05|00:18:11|video crowd is just balls|A
00:18:07|00:18:13|yeah it looks so sharp I have never seen|A
00:18:11|00:18:16|this game with this good so could you|A
00:18:13|00:18:18|get into playing on a big screen like|A
00:18:16|00:18:20|this size at this kind of resolution I|A
00:18:18|00:18:22|think I could get into it yeah probably|A
00:18:20|00:18:25|so I guess that's pretty much the|A
00:18:22|00:18:29|conclusion of this video is it K cool|A
00:18:25|00:18:31|yeah really freakin cool it's glitchy|A
00:18:29|00:18:33|right now and we don't have the|A
00:18:31|00:18:37|performance that we need for it to run|A
00:18:33|00:18:39|its best but when it works man is that|A
00:18:37|00:18:42|incredible now I don't think that|A
00:18:39|00:18:44|sitting this close to a TV in order to|A
00:18:42|00:18:47|appreciate the extra sharpness that 8k|A
00:18:44|00:18:49|provides is necessarily practical but|A
00:18:47|00:18:52|that doesn't mean that in applications|A
00:18:49|00:18:53|like VR where the display is much closer|A
00:18:52|00:18:55|to your eyes and you really need that|A
00:18:53|00:18:56|resolution so you don't get a screen|A
00:18:55|00:18:58|door effect that it won't be an|A
00:18:56|00:19:02|incredible difference maker moving|A
00:18:58|00:19:04|forward we just need much more powerful|A
00:19:02|00:19:06|graphics cards and obviously some work|A
00:19:04|00:19:07|on the software side but with the whole|A
00:19:06|00:19:10|you know not wanting to crash all the|A
00:19:07|00:19:11|time and all that speaking of not|A
00:19:10|00:19:13|wanting to crash all the time I'd hate|A
00:19:11|00:19:15|for you guys to get bored and crash out|A
00:19:13|00:19:18|of this video before I tell you about|A
00:19:15|00:19:19|our sponsor the mass drop HD 6xx|A
00:19:18|00:19:22|headphones are one of mass drops|A
00:19:19|00:19:25|all-time bestsellers with over 60,000|A
00:19:22|00:19:27|units sold and no wonder because they've|A
00:19:25|00:19:31|got an unchanged driver structure from|A
00:19:27|00:19:32|the HD 650s which are an absolute legend|A
00:19:31|00:19:35|they've got a detachable six-foot cable|A
00:19:32|00:19:37|instead of a 10-foot cable unlike the HD|A
00:19:35|00:19:39|650 s but the sound signature is|A
00:19:37|00:19:41|unchanged so you've got nice balance|A
00:19:39|00:19:44|mids natural sounding bass and they're|A
00:19:41|00:19:45|open back for a nice natural soundstage|A
00:19:44|00:19:47|they come with Sennheiser's long-term|A
00:19:45|00:19:49|support and you can buy them at the link|A
00:19:47|00:19:51|below at drop com|NA
00:19:49|00:19:53|so thanks for watching guys if you|NA
00:19:51|00:19:56|disliked this video you can hit that|NA
00:19:53|00:19:58|button but if you liked it hit like get|NA
00:19:56|00:19:59|subscribed or maybe consider checking|NA
00:19:58|00:20:01|out where to buy the stuff we featured|NA
00:19:59|00:20:01|at the link in the video description I|NA
00:20:01|00:20:03|actually think this is one of their|NA
00:20:01|00:20:04|commercial products I have no idea if|NA
00:20:03|00:20:06|you can buy it also in the video|NA
00:20:04|00:20:08|description is our merch store which has|NA
00:20:06|00:20:09|cool shirts like this one and our|NA
00:20:08|00:20:10|community forum which you guys should|NA
00:20:09|00:20:13|totally join|NA
00:20:10|00:20:13|[Music] </st>|NA
00:00:01|00:00:10|<st> I'll do the trick|NA
00:00:03|00:00:12|get him drinking that a couple of months|NA
00:00:10|00:00:15|back nvidia published the data from a|NA
00:00:12|00:00:17|study showing that gamers running on|NA
00:00:15|00:00:20|high refresh rate monitors with faster|NA
00:00:17|00:00:22|pcs were fragging more noobs than their|NA
00:00:20|00:00:24|pleb counterparts who were running low|NA
00:00:22|00:00:27|refresh rate monitors and slower|NA
00:00:24|00:00:29|computers of course their conclusion was|NA
00:00:27|00:00:31|everyone should buy better gear to make|NA
00:00:29|00:00:33|them a better gamer the problem with|NA
00:00:31|00:00:35|their study is that while they did find|NA
00:00:33|00:00:37|a correlation between people with better|NA
00:00:35|00:00:41|equipment and people with more skills a|NA
00:00:37|00:00:44|correlation does not mean causation so a|NA
00:00:41|00:00:47|lot of arguments get made about the|NA
00:00:44|00:00:51|subject of high fps and high refresh|NA
00:00:47|00:00:53|rate gaming and how many FPS is enough|NA
00:00:51|00:00:55|before the I can't see a difference but|NA
00:00:53|00:00:58|one of the key components of a faster|NA
00:00:55|00:01:01|refresh rate display is not in fact the|NA
00:00:58|00:01:03|smoothness of the animation and it is|NA
00:01:01|00:01:05|smoother please don't be ignorant but|NA
00:01:03|00:01:08|rather the frequency with which your eye|NA
00:01:05|00:01:10|receives updated information about the|NA
00:01:08|00:01:13|whereabouts and activities of your|NA
00:01:10|00:01:17|enemies so today's video is all about|NA
00:01:13|00:01:20|determining quantitatively how much|NA
00:01:17|00:01:22|faster a gamer with a 240 Hertz display|NA
00:01:20|00:01:27|will react versus a gamer with a more|NA
00:01:22|00:01:30|traditional 60 Hertz display and we|NA
00:01:27|00:01:33|invited a special guest gavin free of|NA
00:01:30|00:01:36|slo-mo guys and roosterteeth fame is|NA
00:01:33|00:01:38|gonna help us operate this thing to do|NA
00:01:36|00:01:40|it I don't know how to operate this|NA
00:01:38|00:01:42|thing thank goodness he's here I can you|NA
00:01:40|00:01:44|back speaking of thank goodness thank|A
00:01:42|00:01:46|goodness for our sponsor Moss has|A
00:01:44|00:01:48|updated their packs once again and|A
00:01:46|00:01:50|they're combining the best features from|A
00:01:48|00:01:52|their Grande and their black pack into|A
00:01:50|00:01:54|their new moss pack v4 check it out|A
00:01:52|00:01:56|today at the link in the video|A
00:01:54|00:01:56|description|NA
00:02:03|00:02:10|first we want to know if our 240 Hertz|NA
00:02:07|00:02:13|gamer sees the enemy sooner that is to|NA
00:02:10|00:02:15|say we want to know if the up to 12|NA
00:02:13|00:02:19|milliseconds of extra information|NA
00:02:15|00:02:22|actually helps him or her react faster|NA
00:02:19|00:02:24|we also want to know on average if the|NA
00:02:22|00:02:27|smoother animations and the more|NA
00:02:24|00:02:29|frequent updates allow our gamer test|NA
00:02:27|00:02:32|subject here to kill the enemy sooner or|NA
00:02:29|00:02:35|more reliably so here's our test rig on|NA
00:02:32|00:02:38|the right hand side we've got our enemy|NA
00:02:35|00:02:40|or our target which is running a cs go|NA
00:02:38|00:02:43|server on our high-speed local area|NA
00:02:40|00:02:46|network every test needs to be run|NA
00:02:43|00:02:49|exactly the same way so what we'll do is|NA
00:02:46|00:02:51|position this computer's character in|NA
00:02:49|00:02:54|this corner right here so it's in|NA
00:02:51|00:02:56|exactly the same spot then we'll use|NA
00:02:54|00:02:58|this readout in the top left to make|NA
00:02:56|00:03:02|sure that our weapon is pointed at the|NA
00:02:58|00:03:04|exact same pixel then what we do is we|NA
00:03:02|00:03:07|take these two contacts and touch them|NA
00:03:04|00:03:10|together which lights up an LED on our|NA
00:03:07|00:03:12|makeymakey right here that is going to|NA
00:03:10|00:03:15|synchronize with our high-speed camera|NA
00:03:12|00:03:18|when exactly our target begins moving|NA
00:03:15|00:03:21|without making any noise that will alert|NA
00:03:18|00:03:23|our test subject so we're going to be|NA
00:03:21|00:03:26|using the same monitor from Acer for|NA
00:03:23|00:03:28|both our 60 Hertz and our 240 Hertz|NA
00:03:26|00:03:31|tests since the only variable that we're|NA
00:03:28|00:03:33|trying to isolate is the refresh rate|NA
00:03:31|00:03:35|each of our test subjects gets to|NA
00:03:33|00:03:37|practice runs at 60 Hertz to ensure that|NA
00:03:35|00:03:40|they're familiar with the test then|NA
00:03:37|00:03:44|we'll follow with three runs at 60 three|NA
00:03:40|00:03:47|runs at 240 and then four runs two at 60|NA
00:03:44|00:03:49|and two at 240 where the test subject|NA
00:03:47|00:03:52|isn't told the monitor refresh rate each|NA
00:03:49|00:03:54|time so the way that this works is once|NA
00:03:52|00:03:58|again I'm pointing at exactly the same|NA
00:03:54|00:03:59|spot exact pixel and then Ed without me|NA
00:03:58|00:04:02|being able to see what he's doing|NA
00:03:59|00:04:04|starts running at some point now let's|NA
00:04:02|00:04:07|talk about our timing mechanism so it's|NA
00:04:04|00:04:10|probably a little overkill but this here|NA
00:04:07|00:04:13|is a what is this walk us through this|NA
00:04:10|00:04:14|is the fencin flex 4k it's what I've|NA
00:04:13|00:04:16|used for a long time on my channels|NA
00:04:14|00:04:17|about a five-year old camera this|NA
00:04:16|00:04:19|point there's not really any storage|NA
00:04:17|00:04:21|media that can write so fast when you're|NA
00:04:19|00:04:24|taking in that many images so it|NA
00:04:21|00:04:26|requests when internal Ram buffer so|NA
00:04:24|00:04:28|it's always recording five second buffer|NA
00:04:26|00:04:30|and then all I do is just stop it and it|NA
00:04:28|00:04:32|keeps the previous five seconds then we|NA
00:04:30|00:04:36|record that onto this very fast flash|NA
00:04:32|00:04:38|storage these are expensive sadly so the|NA
00:04:36|00:04:40|way the camera works speed wise it has a|NA
00:04:38|00:04:41|certain amount of throughput it can put|NA
00:04:40|00:04:43|in and then you just find the|NA
00:04:41|00:04:44|combination of resolution and speed that|NA
00:04:43|00:04:47|you want so if you lower the resolution|NA
00:04:44|00:04:49|the frame rate goes higher sure so what|NA
00:04:47|00:04:51|are we going to be using well that's up|NA
00:04:49|00:04:53|to you early I shoot everything at 4k|NA
00:04:51|00:04:55|which will give us a max of a thousand|NA
00:04:53|00:04:57|which would probably do pretty well in|NA
00:04:55|00:05:00|these lighting conditions it's kind of|NA
00:04:57|00:05:01|dark at 2000 and also we are relying on|NA
00:05:00|00:05:03|the light coming from the monitors which|NA
00:05:01|00:05:05|I was slightly concerned about but it|NA
00:05:03|00:05:08|looks like it's not too dark okay that's|NA
00:05:05|00:05:09|so much like we have right and then what|NA
00:05:08|00:05:11|should or disappear is the frame because|NA
00:05:09|00:05:13|huh this is like how a fly sees us like|NA
00:05:11|00:05:15|that's what I always think of yeah it's|NA
00:05:13|00:05:18|like we just look like that to fly it|NA
00:05:15|00:05:21|just like casually fly off and flip us|NA
00:05:18|00:05:23|off and we come nowhere close which I do|NA
00:05:21|00:05:25|like a self slap or someone else gets|NA
00:05:23|00:05:27|loved yet how do you want it you want to|NA
00:05:25|00:05:33|slap me you know it has to be pretty|NA
00:05:27|00:05:34|hard right you set up all this test just|NA
00:05:33|00:05:35|so you could screw around with a|NA
00:05:34|00:05:36|high-speed camera right now this is|NA
00:05:35|00:05:37|irrelevant you just wanted the|NA
00:05:36|00:05:39|high-speed camera to get slapped around|NA
00:05:37|00:05:44|that's the whole reason you're here|NA
00:05:39|00:05:44|that's why okay alright slap it|NA
00:05:46|00:05:51|[Music]|NA
00:05:55|00:06:02|my ears ringing oh you know I missed the|NA
00:06:00|00:06:04|trick we do that again you did not you|NA
00:06:02|00:06:09|let you it dragged some skin with that|NA
00:06:04|00:06:10|one look at you know we can't we get two|NA
00:06:09|00:06:13|new staff headshot it's like everyone's|NA
00:06:10|00:06:14|face is tough what you messed up okay|NA
00:06:13|00:06:16|practice run time you need to have like|NA
00:06:14|00:06:18|both hands over there so I have no|NA
00:06:16|00:06:20|movement indication as to when you're|NA
00:06:18|00:06:22|when you're so you want me to trigger it|NA
00:06:20|00:06:24|even if you miss I mean when you miss I|NA
00:06:22|00:06:27|mean if you miss that moment when you|NA
00:06:24|00:06:37|invite someone out and they like insult|NA
00:06:27|00:06:39|you but bonding so it takes me a good|NA
00:06:37|00:06:40|long while to actually even start|NA
00:06:39|00:06:42|tracking the target that's what's gonna|NA
00:06:40|00:06:44|be interesting about this test with the|NA
00:06:42|00:06:47|additional frames that you'll get what|NA
00:06:44|00:06:51|was I doing what was I aiming at the car|NA
00:06:47|00:06:53|I think this video is really about|NA
00:06:51|00:06:56|exposing flaws in counter strikes hit|NA
00:06:53|00:06:58|detection what did you hit there because|NA
00:06:56|00:07:00|I didn't see any impacts and it looked|NA
00:06:58|00:07:02|like it was right on him in your defense|NA
00:07:00|00:07:04|thank you so what we learned from our|NA
00:07:02|00:07:06|first run is that the experiment looks|NA
00:07:04|00:07:08|good but we're gonna do a remedial test|NA
00:07:06|00:07:14|here with the walking speed of our|NA
00:07:08|00:07:16|target slowed down from 322 to 20 but we|NA
00:07:14|00:07:18|also want to try a remedial run here|NA
00:07:16|00:07:21|with the walking speed of our target at|NA
00:07:18|00:07:23|220|NA
00:07:21|00:07:26|to see if that increases our subject|NA
00:07:23|00:07:31|chances of killing the target so let's|NA
00:07:26|00:07:34|try it one more time here okay that's|NA
00:07:31|00:07:35|definitely easier one of the|NA
00:07:34|00:07:38|measurements I'm really looking for here|NA
00:07:35|00:07:40|is time to kill because you're still|NA
00:07:38|00:07:43|gonna clearly be faster to kill the|NA
00:07:40|00:07:46|target it's just a matter of like wow I|NA
00:07:43|00:07:51|really left this to the last moment here|NA
00:07:46|00:07:52|Oh what did I hit did you have a metal|NA
00:07:51|00:07:56|skull what was that|NA
00:07:52|00:07:58|I probably a helmet not a metal school I|NA
00:07:56|00:07:59|think a thousand is doing it for you I|NA
00:07:58|00:08:02|think so we're cuz that's one|NA
00:07:59|00:08:03|millisecond there's nothing like anyone|NA
00:08:02|00:08:05|even advertises as lower than one|NA
00:08:03|00:08:08|millisecond and I think that's|NA
00:08:05|00:08:11|considered well beyond the ability of a|NA
00:08:08|00:08:14|human to perceive anyway it also makes|NA
00:08:11|00:08:16|the math really easy yeah that's|NA
00:08:14|00:08:18|actually the biggest factor thank you so|NA
00:08:16|00:08:21|much again by the way for like being|NA
00:08:18|00:08:23|here this is oh I loved it okay good cuz|NA
00:08:21|00:08:26|your your insight here has actually been|NA
00:08:23|00:08:27|instrumental already to us just kind of|NA
00:08:26|00:08:28|understanding what we're doing yeah this|NA
00:08:27|00:08:31|is this is super fun for me Rock Paper|NA

00:08:31|00:08:34|the kind of person you'd like to say it|NA
00:08:33|00:08:37|as you do it when you just rock paper|NA
00:08:34|00:08:40|and then you go right you go on paper no|NA
00:08:37|00:08:40|no on scissors okay ah|NA

00:08:43|00:08:49|trusty wrong alright okay so I'm first|NA
00:08:48|00:08:52|one thing that's really important is|NA
00:08:49|00:08:54|that Edie is gonna mix up his timing for|NA
00:08:52|00:08:56|when he starts the test so I can't|NA
00:08:54|00:09:00|predict when the target is gonna start|NA
00:08:56|00:09:04|moving okay I am officially ready me to|NA
00:09:00|00:09:04|[Music]|NA
00:09:06|00:09:14|shoot but not hit a|NA

00:09:14|00:09:26|makes you feel any better|NA
00:09:16|00:09:27|this is 84 seconds of unison do you find|NA
00:09:26|00:09:29|that when you're in deep concentration|NA
00:09:27|00:09:31|and you're waiting for it to happen I'm|NA
00:09:29|00:09:32|do you find that you should start|NA
00:09:31|00:09:33|overthinking when it's gonna happen and|NA
00:09:32|00:09:34|then you might miss it cause you're|NA
00:09:33|00:09:41|thinking too much|NA
00:09:34|00:09:43|absolutely oh shit did you just fall out|NA
00:09:41|00:09:45|of the zone right there at the end I|NA
00:09:43|00:09:47|don't know what happened to the eye that|NA
00:09:45|00:09:50|seemed to be the longest it took you to|NA
00:09:47|00:09:53|catch up with them interesting we are|NA
00:09:50|00:09:53|now up to four hundred and sixty-six|NA
00:09:53|00:09:56|gigs|NA
00:09:53|00:09:57|Wow okay that's certainly like less than|NA

00:10:50|00:11:02|feel like I'm improving see I'm happy|NA
00:11:01|00:11:09|with my reaction time|NA
00:11:02|00:11:09|my aim is anus it was very tight anus|NA
00:11:12|00:11:16|not bad|NA
00:11:14|00:11:21|wait a minute what just happened I|NA
00:11:16|00:11:26|pressed play and oh my god I am so sorry|NA
00:11:21|00:11:28|my best attempt and he deleted it can I|NA
00:11:26|00:11:41|feel like we should go until he gets a|NA

00:11:50|00:11:55|don't think so I even see the body oh|NA
00:11:53|00:11:57|that was clean that might be my fastest|NA
00:11:55|00:11:59|one yet yeah mate make sure you save|NA
00:11:57|00:12:00|that one yeah yeah I got you fam we like|NA
00:11:59|00:12:11|that one|NA
00:12:00|00:12:11|I am ready as penis that count|NA
00:12:11|00:12:16|[Music]|NA
00:12:13|00:12:18|I'm just got wet I went way ahead of him|NA
00:12:16|00:12:21|that time so your reaction was fast but|NA
00:12:18|00:12:23|not accurate I was trying to go for like|NA
00:12:21|00:12:28|a wicked snap shot that I don't have|NA
00:12:23|00:12:30|that ability I'm literally the most|NA
00:12:28|00:12:32|experienced I could possibly be and that|NA
00:12:30|00:12:38|was my worst attempt this is so|NA
00:12:32|00:12:39|interesting oh oh wait do you want to do|NA
00:12:38|00:12:51|some practice runs or have you already|NA
00:12:39|00:12:54|tried it a lot of times Wow mr.|NA
00:12:51|00:12:58|confident over here I think that was|NA
00:12:54|00:13:01|actually back and forth like I see at|NA
00:12:58|00:13:03|least five tears when I play yeah I|NA
00:13:01|00:13:05|think we can call out of wait so you|NA
00:13:03|00:13:05|want me to not to save that one yeah I|NA
00:13:05|00:13:11|don't bother|NA
00:13:05|00:13:11|[Music]|NA
00:13:20|00:13:23|[Music]|NA
00:13:24|00:13:28|all right everyone go home guys that was|NA
00:13:26|00:13:31|it already moving before he's even fully|NA
00:13:28|00:13:34|come out that's by far the fastest|NA
00:13:31|00:13:41|reaction we've seen boom headshot as the|NA
00:13:34|00:13:43|kids say I suppose the kids 15 years Oh|NA
00:13:41|00:13:45|boohoo|NA
00:13:43|00:13:45|whatever|NA
00:13:46|00:14:08|not bad did you hit me yeah felt like it|NA
00:14:06|00:14:11|okay last chance|NA
00:14:08|00:14:11|[Music]|NA
00:14:11|00:14:21|wow I wasn't good what are you doing|NA
00:14:18|00:14:24|that was a headlight so it has been|NA
00:14:21|00:14:27|quite a few hours the time is now 1141|NA
00:14:24|00:14:30|and we're all still at it especially edy|NA
00:14:27|00:14:32|who has been painstakingly compiling the|NA
00:14:30|00:14:37|data and is now sharing it with us so|NA
00:14:32|00:14:41|your average for 60 Hertz is 257 yeah is|NA
00:14:37|00:14:43|that in frames yes but that's 257|NA
00:14:41|00:14:47|milliseconds effectively okay and then|NA
00:14:43|00:14:49|194 for 240 Hertz so that doesn't even|NA
00:14:47|00:14:51|make sense how you could be that much|NA
00:14:49|00:14:53|faster because theoretically you should|NA
00:14:51|00:14:59|only have that best a 12 millisecond|NA
00:14:53|00:15:02|advantage interesting so I am the|NA
00:14:59|00:15:05|slowest by a long shot|NA
00:15:02|00:15:09|oh you're up in the 300 sometimes yeah|NA
00:15:05|00:15:12|that's an eternity now could be that you|NA
00:15:09|00:15:17|waited to see the person quite a bit|NA
00:15:12|00:15:19|more and then I guess so now you were|NA
00:15:17|00:15:21|the most consistent consistently average|NA
00:15:19|00:15:23|I feel like whenever I saw anything I|NA
00:15:21|00:15:25|would just kind of spasm my hand away|NA
00:15:23|00:15:27|and try and just catch up with it later|NA
00:15:25|00:15:30|but I think that's just down to me is|NA
00:15:27|00:15:34|just not being very good maybe it was|NA
00:15:30|00:15:34|more of a focus thing yeah|NA
00:15:37|00:15:43|audience this was actually previously|NA
00:15:39|00:15:48|passed 854 milliseconds and when you|NA
00:15:43|00:15:50|consider that I had a 360 millisecond|NA
00:15:48|00:15:53|reaction time it actually only took me|NA
00:15:50|00:15:55|half a second to kill the target once I|NA
00:15:53|00:16:01|started moving that's really good|NA
00:15:55|00:16:05|actually not as good a second and a half|NA
00:16:01|00:16:08|overall and kill wise you're the same|NA
00:16:05|00:16:08|[Music]|NA
00:16:12|00:16:17|look it is fake humility hey I feel like|NA
00:16:16|00:16:19|there's so many more variables that|NA
00:16:17|00:16:21|aren't measured here like how in the|NA
00:16:19|00:16:27|zone we were like what the the other|NA
00:16:21|00:16:29|person is psyching us out as I must this|NA
00:16:27|00:16:31|is the pressure building up I feel like|NA
00:16:29|00:16:34|on my last attempt I was always freaking|NA
00:16:31|00:16:35|out way more than my previous ones yeah|NA
00:16:34|00:16:39|actually that's another thing too like|NA
00:16:35|00:16:39|if I missed one I was like tense on my|NA
00:16:39|00:16:42|next one|NA
00:16:39|00:16:45|I gotta make up for for a bad one if I|NA
00:16:42|00:16:46|only concentrated on being ready for the|NA
00:16:45|00:16:48|guys to come around the corner and I was|NA
00:16:46|00:16:50|all I was thinking about I could only do|NA
00:16:48|00:16:52|that for like four seconds until I was|NA
00:16:50|00:16:55|thinking about doing that and it would|NA
00:16:52|00:16:56|just wreck my concentration I mean|NA
00:16:55|00:16:59|obviously we're watching this in slow|NA
00:16:56|00:17:02|motion so it's very exaggerated but this|NA
00:16:59|00:17:04|makes me wonder how I ever played|NA
00:17:02|00:17:06|anything at 30 frames a second and I|NA
00:17:04|00:17:08|regularly do like if I'm playing GTA 5|NA
00:17:06|00:17:10|on xbox that's running 30 this may have|NA
00:17:08|00:17:11|ruined me even more for refresh rates|NA
00:17:10|00:17:14|and frame rates|NA
00:17:11|00:17:15|alright so GAD flew home last night but|NA
00:17:14|00:17:18|for giggles we spent some more time|NA
00:17:15|00:17:22|analyzing the data and found some really|NA
00:17:18|00:17:25|cool things one everyone's reaction|NA
00:17:22|00:17:28|times were better at 240 Hertz and|NA
00:17:25|00:17:31|strangely by more than just 12|NA
00:17:28|00:17:33|milliseconds if I had to guess I'd say|NA
00:17:31|00:17:35|part of this is because it's easier to|NA
00:17:33|00:17:38|track where the target is headed and|NA
00:17:35|00:17:42|then decide where to move the cursor|NA
00:17:38|00:17:44|before you begin to move to every single|NA
00:17:42|00:17:47|test subject was more likely to kill the|NA
00:17:44|00:17:49|opponent at 240 Hertz in the limited|NA
00:17:47|00:17:52|amount of time that they had and|NA
00:17:49|00:17:55|three the way that high refresh rate|NA
00:17:52|00:17:57|affects your gaming could end up being|NA
00:17:55|00:18:00|heavily dependent on the way that you|NA
00:17:57|00:18:04|aim so take a look at this map of all of|NA
00:18:00|00:18:07|my shots my accuracy and my precision|NA
00:18:04|00:18:10|were both actually very similar at 60|NA
00:18:07|00:18:14|versus 240 Hertz so regardless of|NA
00:18:10|00:18:16|refresh rate I'm taking my time tracking|NA
00:18:14|00:18:18|the target and only pulling the trigger|NA
00:18:16|00:18:21|when I think I've got a clean shot and|NA
00:18:18|00:18:23|it's funny it's not something I've ever|NA
00:18:21|00:18:25|thought about would it make sense now|NA
00:18:23|00:18:26|that I'm looking at it because I'm|NA
00:18:25|00:18:29|totally one of those jackasses that|NA
00:18:26|00:18:31|grabs the sniper class so everyone else|NA
00:18:29|00:18:34|has to play medic or whatever so for me|NA
00:18:31|00:18:35|revealing my position is always a factor|NA
00:18:34|00:18:38|in the back of my mind|NA
00:18:35|00:18:39|don't pull the trigger unless I think|NA
00:18:38|00:18:42|I'm gonna hit something all right now|NA
00:18:39|00:18:45|let's look at Ed's 'el Ed's more of like|NA
00:18:42|00:18:48|a flick shot kind of player so he tends|NA
00:18:45|00:18:49|to react and shoot first and figure out|NA
00:18:48|00:18:51|the other details later|NA
00:18:49|00:18:54|now as the most skilled of our test|NA
00:18:51|00:18:57|subjects she clearly benefited the most|NA
00:18:54|00:18:59|from high refresh rate and said that it|NA
00:18:57|00:19:03|helped him time the release of his shot|NA
00:18:59|00:19:04|much better as he panned across his|NA
00:19:03|00:19:07|target|NA
00:19:04|00:19:09|finally there's gap in fairness to gap|NA
00:19:07|00:19:12|no one really aims only with their mouse|NA
00:19:09|00:19:13|like it's much easier to strength while|NA
00:19:12|00:19:16|you're trying to line up a shot like|NA
00:19:13|00:19:19|this but his results were still far and|NA
00:19:16|00:19:24|away the worst at both refresh rates if|NA
00:19:19|00:19:27|that said at 240 Hertz his precision was|NA
00:19:24|00:19:30|much higher so if he was a little closer|NA
00:19:27|00:19:31|to the target the improvement in his|NA
00:19:30|00:19:33|consistency would have definitely|NA
00:19:31|00:19:37|resulted in more kills|NA
00:19:33|00:19:39|so in conclusion yes high refresh rate|NA
00:19:37|00:19:41|gaming makes a difference it's the kind|NA
00:19:39|00:19:44|of thing we've always felt but it was|NA
00:19:41|00:19:46|never something that we've quantified|NA
00:19:44|00:19:48|now I think there's still a lot more|NA
00:19:46|00:19:50|work to do investigating this may be|NA
00:19:48|00:19:53|part two could involve different mouse|NA
00:19:50|00:19:55|sensitivity settings some professional|NA
00:19:53|00:19:57|players I don't know hit us up in the|NA
00:19:55|00:19:59|comments if you've got some ideas but|NA
00:19:57|00:20:00|for now we feel like this is a pretty|NA
00:19:59|00:20:02|good place to leave it|NA
