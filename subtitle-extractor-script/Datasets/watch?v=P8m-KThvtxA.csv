00:00:35|00:00:36|to be on the show,|NA
00:00:36|00:00:39|but then one of the friends that was traveling with us|NA

00:00:41|00:00:43|"Look! It's at 20 million!"""|NA

00:01:03|00:01:05|-He'd be so proud. -Thank you so much.|NA
00:01:05|00:01:10|-But your mom posted a photo of your dad when he was your age|NA
00:01:10|00:01:11|and you.|NA
00:01:11|00:01:12|Look at this. You won't believe this.|NA
00:01:12|00:01:13|-Yeah, it's a bit wild.|NA
00:01:13|00:01:15|[ Laughs ]|NA
00:01:15|00:01:16|-I mean, that's -- That's wild. -Yeah.|NA

00:01:21|00:01:24|-Yeah, well, when -- when my mum first showed this to me,|NA
00:01:24|00:01:26|I thought it was me.|NA
00:01:26|00:01:27|-I-I can't tell them apart. -Yeah.|NA
00:01:27|00:01:29|"-And I said, ""It's me. What's the big deal?"""|NA
00:01:29|00:01:31|And until you look at Dad's shirt,|NA
00:01:31|00:01:34|you don't even realize that it's two different people.|NA
00:01:34|00:01:35|"-You're like, ""I wouldn't wear that."""|NA
00:01:35|00:01:36|-[ Laughs ] Yeah.|NA
00:01:36|00:01:38|"-""That's too psychedelic for me, man."""|NA
00:01:38|00:01:40|Yeah. All right.|NA
00:01:40|00:01:42|So, you brought some animals and creatures here tonight.|NA
00:01:42|00:01:43|-Yes, we have. -Let's bring them out.|NA
00:01:43|00:01:44|-What did you bring?|NA
00:01:44|00:01:46|What did you bring to scare me with tonight?|NA
00:01:46|00:01:48|-All right. So, first up, we have Jane.|NA
00:01:48|00:01:50|-Is that a man? Oh, no, okay, okay.|NA
00:01:50|00:01:52|-And Jane... -Okay. Oh, no, no, no.|NA
00:01:52|00:01:54|-...is a dictator scorpion.|NA
00:01:54|00:01:56|-See? Nah, nah, nah. -And Jane is absolutely amazing.|NA
00:01:56|00:01:58|And you're welcome to come close.|NA
00:01:58|00:02:00|She's very calm. She's really nice.|NA
00:02:00|00:02:02|She's actually quite friendly.|NA
00:02:02|00:02:04|-No, that's impossible. It's a scorpion.|NA
00:02:04|00:02:06|How could a scorpion be friendly?|NA
00:02:06|00:02:08|Well, she's curling her tail. That means something, right?|NA
00:02:08|00:02:10|-Yeah. Well, that tail actually contains her venom.|NA
00:02:10|00:02:12|She's got quite a bit of venom.|NA
00:02:12|00:02:16|And they actually inject that venom to kill their prey.|NA
00:02:16|00:02:17|And isn't she just magnificent?|NA
00:02:17|00:02:19|-She's curling it up. She's getting it --|NA
00:02:19|00:02:20|She's, like, balling her fist, ready to go.|NA
00:02:20|00:02:22|-Yeah, but if you look closely,|NA
00:02:22|00:02:24|see those little hairs along her little little pinchers?|NA
00:02:24|00:02:25|-Yeah. -And it's interesting|NA
00:02:25|00:02:28|'cause the bigger the pinchers, the less venomous they are,|NA
00:02:28|00:02:30|but if they have smaller pinchers,|NA
00:02:30|00:02:32|that means they pack a lot of venom.|NA
00:02:32|00:02:34|[ Laughs ] It's pretty interesting, isn't it?|NA
00:02:34|00:02:36|-I don't know how you're that calm. I mean, it's real, right?|NA
00:02:36|00:02:38|That's really moving. I don't like that.|NA
00:02:38|00:02:39|-Yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely. -That thing frightens me.|NA
00:02:39|00:02:41|-Absolutely. -They're so cool.|NA
00:02:41|00:02:42|They're actually nocturnal, as well.|NA
00:02:42|00:02:43|-They hunt at night. -Oh, perfect.|NA
00:02:43|00:02:45|-Yeah. -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.|NA
00:02:45|00:02:47|I run into that thing at night.|NA
00:02:47|00:02:48|Get this thing out of here, please.|NA
00:02:48|00:02:50|-It's beautiful. -Okay. No worries.|NA
00:02:50|00:02:51|-Thank you. What a beautiful creature.|NA
00:02:51|00:02:53|-Yeah, they're gorgeous.|NA
00:02:53|00:02:55|Thank you.|NA
00:02:55|00:02:57|-Ahh. Don't you have anything cute?|NA
00:02:57|00:02:59|-Well, this -- this animal is a little bit more cute.|NA
00:02:59|00:03:01|So, how about you come around in front of the desk?|NA
00:03:01|00:03:03|-Okay. Okay. -All right. Okay.|NA
00:03:03|00:03:05|So, let's bring out our next animal.|NA
00:03:05|00:03:07|-I want you to sit down. -Okay.|NA
00:03:07|00:03:09|-All right. Ready? -Yeah.|NA
00:03:09|00:03:12|These -- [ Laughs ] These are baby black bears.|NA
00:03:12|00:03:15|-Oh, my God. -Aren't they beautiful?|NA
00:03:15|00:03:17|Oh, don't -- don't -- don't do that.|NA
00:03:17|00:03:19|-Don't do that. -Ah! Ooh! Ow!|NA
00:03:19|00:03:21|-You can -- You can let -- You can let him go.|NA
00:03:21|00:03:22|You can let her go. There you go.|NA
00:03:22|00:03:23|-All right. This is a baby bear?|NA
00:03:23|00:03:25|-I think she's kind of just chewing on --|NA
00:03:25|00:03:26|She's chewing on your thumb a little bit.|NA
00:03:26|00:03:28|-Yeah, she definitely was chewing on my thumb.|NA
00:03:28|00:03:30|-Absolutely. -They're so funny.|NA
00:03:30|00:03:33|So, these baby bears are kind of hyperactive when they're little.|NA
00:03:33|00:03:35|They love exploring. -How old are they?|NA
00:03:35|00:03:37|-Well, these ones actually are only a couple months old.|NA
00:03:37|00:03:40|They will get quite a bit larger than this, though.|NA
00:03:40|00:03:42|Oh, sorry, sorry. Sorry about that.|NA
00:03:42|00:03:44|-Let's not get them angry. Yeah, yeah.|NA
00:03:44|00:03:45|-They're really special.|NA
00:03:45|00:03:47|Now, these guys are actually omnivores.|NA
00:03:47|00:03:50|So they'll eat meat, and they'll also eat vegetables.|NA
00:03:50|00:03:52|-[ Laughs ] -Don't chew on the wire.|NA
00:03:52|00:03:55|-No, don't chew that. -Do they eat -- No.|NA
00:03:55|00:03:57|They're omnivores, so they eat both vegetables|NA
00:03:57|00:03:59|-and meat, as well? -Yeah, yeah, they do.|NA
00:03:59|00:04:02|They love flowers and little berries and things like that.|NA
00:04:02|00:04:05|-No, don't do -- -He's very cute.|NA
00:04:05|00:04:07|How big will they get?|NA
00:04:07|00:04:08|-Well, this one could actually get|NA
00:04:08|00:04:10|maybe up to about 300 pounds.|NA
00:04:10|00:04:12|So they can get quite large.|NA
00:04:12|00:04:14|-Please remember me, okay? Please. Yeah.|NA
00:04:14|00:04:16|When you get older. Oh, that is fantastic.|NA
00:04:16|00:04:18|-Oh, look at this one climbing on my back.|NA
00:04:18|00:04:19|-They're really cute. Come here.|NA

00:04:21|00:04:24|-This one is -- [ Laughs ] This one is D-9.|NA
00:04:24|00:04:26|-Kind of sounds like a rapper. -D-9? Yeah, it does.|NA

00:04:28|00:04:30|-D-9. Oh, hi, D-9. -Yeah.|NA
00:04:30|00:04:32|-All right. And what's this guy's name?|NA
00:04:32|00:04:34|-And, so, this one here -- No, don't chew Jimmy.|NA
00:04:34|00:04:36|-It's all right. It's okay.|NA
00:04:36|00:04:38|-All she wants to do is just chew you.|NA
00:04:38|00:04:40|-Aww. -And this one is Flo.|NA
00:04:40|00:04:43|Flo is really cute. She's got a great name.|NA
00:04:43|00:04:45|[ Laughs ] Oh, aren't they gorgeous?|NA
00:04:45|00:04:48|-That was the closest I ever came to a bear. This is so cool.|NA
00:04:48|00:04:50|All right. I'm going to -- Yeah, I want to --|NA
00:04:50|00:04:52|-So, do you want to -- -I survived this.|NA
00:04:52|00:04:53|So I'm happy about this. -All right, okay, okay.|NA
00:04:53|00:04:56|I think it's time for you guys to head off.|NA
00:04:56|00:04:58|-Bye, guys. Thank you. -What nice bears.|NA
00:04:58|00:05:01|-Have fun. Bye, D-9. -Bye!|NA

00:05:06|00:05:08|-Whew! -Aren't they hilarious?|NA
00:05:08|00:05:10|-That was a big step for me. Yeah, they are cute.|NA
00:05:10|00:05:11|-They're so funny. -All right.|NA

00:05:13|00:05:14|we -- we -- [ Laughs ]|NA
00:05:14|00:05:16|We have another cute animal for you.|NA
00:05:16|00:05:17|-Okay, good.|NA
00:05:17|00:05:19|-And they have very cute names, as well.|NA
00:05:19|00:05:21|-This is Lulu and Fluffy. -Fluffy and Lulu, good.|NA
00:05:21|00:05:22|-Now, the -- I know what you're thinking. They're not snakes.|NA
00:05:22|00:05:24|Don't worry. They're -- They're all good.|NA
00:05:24|00:05:26|They're actually legless lizards.|NA
00:05:26|00:05:28|So, these legless lizards --|NA
00:05:28|00:05:30|-That's not Lulu and Fluffy at all.|NA
00:05:30|00:05:32|-Yeah, Lulu and Fluffy. -I think that's D-9.|NA
00:05:32|00:05:33|-You want to hold Fluffy? -Oh, my gosh.|NA
00:05:33|00:05:35|-You're welcome to hold him. He loves being held.|NA
00:05:35|00:05:37|-I really don't want to hold these things.|NA
00:05:37|00:05:39|-There you go. Oh, good job! -Oh, gosh!|NA
00:05:39|00:05:41|What are these things? They're not -- They're snakes.|NA
00:05:41|00:05:43|-No, they're legless lizards. [ Laughter ]|NA
00:05:43|00:05:45|And you can tell the difference...|NA
00:05:45|00:05:47|[ Laughter and applause ]|NA
00:05:47|00:05:48|-I'm an idiot.|NA

00:05:49|00:05:50|You can tell the difference --|NA
00:05:50|00:05:52|-Legless lizards? This one's not moving.|NA
00:05:52|00:05:54|-You can see those little ears there.|NA
00:05:54|00:05:57|He actually has ears. Snakes don't have ears.|NA
00:05:57|00:05:59|So that's one of the biggest reasons why --|NA
00:05:59|00:06:00|how you can actually tell the difference.|NA
00:06:00|00:06:02|They're really special.|NA
00:06:02|00:06:03|-He -- Why -- It feels like he's gonna strike or something.|NA
00:06:03|00:06:06|Why is he staring at me? -He won't strike. It's all good.|NA
00:06:06|00:06:08|I think he's just trying to work out what you're doing.|NA
00:06:08|00:06:09|It's okay. You'll be fine.|NA
00:06:09|00:06:10|-What -- What should I be doing? -Uh.|NA
00:06:10|00:06:11|[ Laughter ]|NA
00:06:11|00:06:12|-What -- I mean, I'm holding him.|NA
00:06:12|00:06:14|-Just hold still. He's actually quite calm.|NA
00:06:14|00:06:15|-Well, I'm -- -And you'll be fine.|NA
00:06:15|00:06:17|-We're both stiff as a board.|NA
00:06:17|00:06:19|We're, like, freaked out right now.|NA

00:06:20|00:06:21|The heck? The heck is --|NA
00:06:21|00:06:22|-You want me to take him off you?|NA
00:06:22|00:06:24|-Yes! I want you to take him away from me.|NA
00:06:24|00:06:25|-There you go. -Gosh, that was awkward.|NA
00:06:25|00:06:27|Don't make me do that -- Don't make me do that again.|NA
00:06:27|00:06:29|-They're so cool, aren't they?|NA
00:06:29|00:06:30|-No, these are the creepiest things --|NA
00:06:30|00:06:31|-They're so much fun. They actually --|NA
00:06:31|00:06:32|-Where do they live?|NA
00:06:32|00:06:33|-They -- [ Chuckles ] These ones live --|NA
00:06:33|00:06:35|-In the water. They surprise you in the pool.|NA
00:06:35|00:06:37|-No, no, they live in Europe.|NA
00:06:37|00:06:38|These are the European legless Lizards.|NA
00:06:38|00:06:40|-Oh, well. [ Chuckles ] -And they can grow quite large.|NA
00:06:40|00:06:43|They can get up to about 3 feet in length.|NA
00:06:43|00:06:44|-Oh, God!|NA
00:06:44|00:06:45|-And they'll -- they'll eat little insects|NA
00:06:45|00:06:46|and little eggs and things like that.|NA
00:06:46|00:06:48|-Little insects? Yeah.|NA
00:06:48|00:06:49|-Yeah, so they're kind of just like a lizard,|NA
00:06:49|00:06:50|but obviously don't have any legs.|NA
00:06:50|00:06:51|-This is cool. -All right.|NA
00:06:51|00:06:53|-I had my good experience with these guys.|NA
00:06:53|00:06:54|-Awesome. -Bye, Fluffy.|NA

00:07:00|00:07:01|-All right, already, I'm, like, freaking out.|NA
00:07:01|00:07:03|This is -- This is like a stress test for me.|NA
00:07:03|00:07:04|Yeah. All right.|NA
