00:01:02|00:01:07|team we went with was Manchester United|NA
00:01:04|00:01:11|because look at their budget who hunt no|NA

00:01:17|00:01:22|even more money is add the financial|NA
00:01:20|00:01:24|takeover to this we're just gonna try to|NA
00:01:22|00:01:26|make Manchester United even more rich|NA
00:01:24|00:01:28|than they already are here we go guys|NA
00:01:26|00:01:31|we're equipping the financial takeover|NA
00:01:28|00:01:32|redeem item that will take place in a|NA
00:01:31|00:01:34|few days and we should get that extra|NA
00:01:32|00:01:37|cash the next thing we're gonna do here|NA
00:01:34|00:01:39|is go and try to list a ton of players|NA
00:01:37|00:01:41|on United so here we go we're gonna put|NA
00:01:39|00:01:43|Paul Pogba on the transfer list Javed|NA
00:01:41|00:01:46|daheia on the transfer list Alexey|NA
00:01:43|00:01:47|Sanchez just arrived so I don't think we|NA
00:01:46|00:01:50|can sell him right away|NA
00:01:47|00:01:51|Lukaku also just arrived Marcial we|NA
00:01:50|00:01:52|could add to the transfer list and you|NA
00:01:51|00:01:54|guys get the point I'm just gonna add|NA
00:01:52|00:01:56|basically all the big name players so we|NA
00:01:54|00:01:57|can sell them I forgot to mention one of|NA
00:01:56|00:02:00|the reasons we're starting with 200|NA
00:01:57|00:02:02|million pounds is because we added the|NA
00:02:00|00:02:03|60% transfer increase at the beginning|NA
00:02:02|00:02:05|of the season one thing we've done as|NA
00:02:03|00:02:08|well is entered United in the preseason|NA
00:02:05|00:02:09|tournament because if we go on and win|NA
00:02:08|00:02:11|the preseason tournament then if we get|NA
00:02:09|00:02:12|an extra ten million to our transfer|NA
00:02:11|00:02:13|budget we really need as much money as|NA
00:02:12|00:02:15|we can|NA
00:02:13|00:02:17|because signing Messi Ronaldo and Neymar|NA
00:02:15|00:02:18|is gonna be so hard to do and look at|NA
00:02:17|00:02:20|this we get our first offer for Chris|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|Smalling we're gonna be selling every|NA
00:02:20|00:02:24|one just so we can get that cash Chris|NA
00:02:22|00:02:26|Smalling 16 mil offer from Dortmund|NA
00:02:24|00:02:28|let's go and accept that the financial|NA
00:02:26|00:02:30|takeover actually went through and I was|NA
00:02:28|00:02:32|expecting to get a little bit more we|NA
00:02:30|00:02:34|got about a hundred million pounds from|NA
00:02:32|00:02:36|the financial takeover move so now we|NA
00:02:34|00:02:38|have three hundred over three hundred|NA
00:02:36|00:02:40|million pounds I mean that is insane so|NA
00:02:38|00:02:41|we have the three players shortlisted|NA
00:02:40|00:02:43|right here and the players will be going|NA
00:02:41|00:02:46|forward during this transfer window our|NA
00:02:43|00:02:48|Messi and Ronaldo the reason we can't|NA
00:02:46|00:02:50|sign Neymar at least in this transfer|NA
00:02:48|00:02:52|window is because he just arrived to PSG|NA
00:02:50|00:02:54|so we're gonna have to wait until most|NA
00:02:52|00:02:55|likely the winter if we can't sign them|NA
00:02:54|00:02:56|during the winter|NA
00:02:55|00:02:58|we'll wait till next summer transfer|NA
00:02:56|00:03:00|window to sign up and I guess why not|NA
00:02:58|00:03:03|just go in for Ronaldo straight away|NA
00:03:00|00:03:05|let's approach to buy the Real Madrid|NA
00:03:03|00:03:08|man Oh God okay I think what we're gonna|NA
00:03:05|00:03:13|be doing here is offering either Lukaku|NA
00:03:08|00:03:16|or Sanchez if it lets us let's go to|NA
00:03:13|00:03:18|player swap here we go|NA
00:03:16|00:03:20|Ramallah Lukaku right here let's see|NA
00:03:18|00:03:22|what they say about this just swapping|NA
00:03:20|00:03:23|straight up for Ronaldo for Lukaku|NA
00:03:22|00:03:26|they're looking to bring in the left|NA
00:03:23|00:03:28|winger so I guess we offer Alexis|NA
00:03:26|00:03:29|Sanchez right let's see what they say|NA
00:03:28|00:03:31|about that I know they're gonna ask for|NA
00:03:29|00:03:33|like a hundred million as well plus|NA
00:03:31|00:03:35|Alexis Sanchez a hundred and twelve|NA

00:03:35|00:03:39|quick and propose a new transfer fee|NA
00:03:37|00:03:43|let's see if they'll just do straight up|NA
00:03:39|00:03:44|one hundred million plus Alexis Sanchez|NA
00:03:43|00:03:46|for Ronaldo they don't they're not|NA
00:03:44|00:03:48|willing to budge okay I think we just|NA

00:03:48|00:03:53|hundred million pounds plus Lukaku|NA
00:03:51|00:03:57|yes they're happy with it okay so|NA

00:06:46|00:06:50|want is or what he's gonna want is|NA
00:06:48|00:06:52|probably a really really big wage|NA
00:06:50|00:06:54|because this is the hardest part in|NA
00:06:52|00:06:55|signing Leo Messi first|NA
00:06:54|00:06:57|yes we're gonna accept that a crucial|NA

00:06:57|00:07:02|how many years he wants on his contract|NA
00:06:59|00:07:03|I think he said he wanted three I'm|NA
00:07:02|00:07:06|gonna offer him 30 and see what he says|NA
00:07:03|00:07:09|okay they are okay with three years so|NA
00:07:06|00:07:10|he isn't considering adding a release|NA
00:07:09|00:07:12|clause we don't care about that yet we|NA
00:07:10|00:07:13|don't want to release clause either come|NA
00:07:12|00:07:15|on|NA
00:07:13|00:07:18|yeah we'll accept that next is going to|NA
00:07:15|00:07:20|be the contract okay what does he ones|NA
00:07:18|00:07:23|oh that's no we'll definitely accept|NA
00:07:20|00:07:25|that five mm week yeah that's 100%|NA
00:07:23|00:07:27|acceptable Messi's joined so we've got|NA
00:07:25|00:07:29|Ronaldo we've got messy now we just need|NA
00:07:27|00:07:31|Neymar I thought this would be a little|NA
00:07:29|00:07:35|bit more tough but I guess since we have|NA
00:07:31|00:07:36|the money it's just very not easy but|NA
00:07:35|00:07:38|it's more easier than it would have been|NA
00:07:36|00:07:39|if we didn't do like the financial|NA
00:07:38|00:07:41|takeover and we weren't selling all|NA
00:07:39|00:07:43|these players I didn't forget to mention|NA
00:07:41|00:07:45|during the summer transfer window when I|NA
00:07:43|00:07:48|kind of Sims we did sell a lot of|NA
00:07:45|00:07:51|players so you'll see players like Luc|NA
00:07:48|00:07:53|Shaw's gone I believe we sold a ton of|NA
00:07:51|00:07:55|others we sold Romero so you look at our|NA
00:07:53|00:07:56|team we only have eight players on the|NA
00:07:55|00:08:00|reserves|NA
00:07:56|00:08:01|let's put Messi in to the starting|NA
00:08:00|00:08:03|lineup what are we doing here yeah let's|NA
00:08:01|00:08:05|put him at right wing for lingard and|NA
00:08:03|00:08:06|now we just need well I guess we could|NA
00:08:05|00:08:08|do that because Neymar will go on that|NA
00:08:06|00:08:10|right wing if we could sign him though|NA
00:08:08|00:08:13|the last player we need boys the thing|NA
00:08:10|00:08:14|is we can go into negotiations right now|NA
00:08:13|00:08:16|with Neymar but I don't think we're|NA
00:08:14|00:08:18|gonna have enough money to sign him I|NA
00:08:16|00:08:20|think he's gonna cost over 150 million|NA
00:08:18|00:08:23|and we only have a hundred and twelve|NA
00:08:20|00:08:25|million plus no wages we need to either|NA
00:08:23|00:08:27|sell Lukaku or daheia first before we|NA
00:08:25|00:08:29|can even think about signing Neymar so|NA
00:08:27|00:08:31|what we just did right now is accepted|NA
00:08:29|00:08:32|an offer for Fellaini|NA
00:08:31|00:08:34|again I'm just gonna be trying to sell a|NA
00:08:32|00:08:37|ton of players right now so we can get|NA
00:08:34|00:08:38|enough cash to sign Neymar or offers|NA
00:08:37|00:08:41|coming in as we are going to loan out|NA
