00:00:12|00:00:17|might make in the technical interview|NA
00:00:15|00:00:20|now I might be qualified to talk about|NA
00:00:17|00:00:21|this because I am an ex-googler engineer|NA
00:00:20|00:00:23|tech lead and I've done over 100|NA
00:00:21|00:00:25|technical interviews and I've seen them|A
00:00:23|00:00:27|on today's video by the way is brought|A
00:00:25|00:00:28|to you by brilliant org an educational|A
00:00:27|00:00:30|website where you can learn about|A
00:00:28|00:00:33|algorithms computer science fundamentals|A
00:00:30|00:00:35|math probability statistics and the|A
00:00:33|00:00:36|whole range of topics that can help you|A
00:00:35|00:00:38|increase your technical fundamentals and|A
00:00:36|00:00:40|knowledge to make sure that you pass|A
00:00:38|00:00:42|your next technical interview with|A
00:00:40|00:00:45|flying colors so that you can see that|A
00:00:42|00:00:47|light of success now there are a lot of|NA
00:00:45|00:00:49|common mistakes that newcomers and|NA
00:00:47|00:00:51|veterans alike will make when they walk|NA
00:00:49|00:00:53|into a technical interview and having|NA
00:00:51|00:00:55|done so many interviews in my past I|NA
00:00:53|00:00:57|will be able to clearly see a lot of|NA
00:00:55|00:00:59|mistakes these are common mistakes that|NA
00:00:57|00:01:01|you can easily correct and they're going|NA
00:00:59|00:01:03|to be applicable not just for technical|NA
00:01:01|00:01:05|interviews but also for any interview|NA
00:01:03|00:01:06|and any interaction in general and I|NA
00:01:05|00:01:08|think that these are going to be great|NA
00:01:06|00:01:11|philosophies upon which you may live|NA
00:01:08|00:01:13|your life and base your life on now the|NA
00:01:11|00:01:16|technical interview generally consists|NA
00:01:13|00:01:18|of five to six short 45-minute sessions|NA
00:01:16|00:01:19|and these are sessions in which you have|NA
00:01:18|00:01:22|to prove yourself you only have one|NA
00:01:19|00:01:24|chance per session to show why you're|NA
00:01:22|00:01:27|the person who's qualified and if any|NA
00:01:24|00:01:30|one of these people give you a low mark|NA
00:01:27|00:01:32|a low score then your chances are going|NA
00:01:30|00:01:33|to be really up against you because a|NA
00:01:32|00:01:36|lot of these companies believe in the|NA
00:01:33|00:01:38|idea of not hiring false positives they|NA
00:01:36|00:01:40|were biased towards not giving you the|NA
00:01:38|00:01:42|benefit of the doubt if they don't know|NA
00:01:40|00:01:44|if the signals not clear then it's just|NA
00:01:42|00:01:45|going to be a pass because there's going|NA
00:01:44|00:01:47|to be enough people who can give a|NA
00:01:45|00:01:49|strong higher signal and if they|NA
00:01:47|00:01:51|accidentally make a bad hire is really|NA
00:01:49|00:01:52|costly for the company to try to fix|NA
00:01:51|00:01:54|those mistakes and so that's why a lot|NA
00:01:52|00:01:56|of companies will just err on the side|NA
00:01:54|00:01:59|of not hiring people if they're not|NA
00:01:56|00:02:01|really sure so one funny thing is of|NA
00:01:59|00:02:04|this panel of interviewers it's not like|NA
00:02:01|00:02:06|anyone really has the ability to just|NA
00:02:04|00:02:07|say well yeah we should hire you we want|NA
00:02:06|00:02:09|to be nice to you and just give you that|NA
00:02:07|00:02:11|high higher mark because overall you|NA
00:02:09|00:02:13|will need everybody or most people to|NA
00:02:11|00:02:15|give you that positive higher score|NA
00:02:13|00:02:17|if only one person gives you the a|NA
00:02:15|00:02:19|higher score that's just not going to be|NA
00:02:17|00:02:21|enough however it will be enough if one|NA
00:02:19|00:02:23|person gives a negative score sometimes|NA
00:02:21|00:02:25|you just sync your whole interview|NA
00:02:23|00:02:27|process like if one person just said|NA
00:02:25|00:02:28|that you're a jerk that could be enough|NA
00:02:27|00:02:30|to just think you although not|NA
00:02:28|00:02:32|necessarily you may have noticed by the|NA
00:02:30|00:02:39|way that were several minutes into the|NA
00:02:32|00:02:40|video by now so let's just get into it|NA
00:02:39|00:02:42|let's get into it|NA
00:02:40|00:02:44|tip number one what's tip number one|NA
00:02:42|00:02:46|well let's talk about tip number one and|NA
00:02:44|00:02:49|what I'm going to tell you now is my top|NA
00:02:46|00:02:51|number one tip on what mistake people|NA
00:02:49|00:02:54|make when interviewing for the technical|NA
00:02:51|00:03:00|interview so stay tuned because that's|NA
00:02:54|00:03:02|coming up right now that tip is that tip|NA
00:03:00|00:03:04|is and it's really the only reason that|NA
00:03:02|00:03:07|I thought of making this video really|NA
00:03:04|00:03:10|for you that tip is to get a referral|NA
00:03:07|00:03:12|don't just think that you can do it on|NA
00:03:10|00:03:14|your own and this is one mistake that I|NA
00:03:12|00:03:16|made when I first began applying for|NA
00:03:14|00:03:18|jobs straight out of college I was|NA
00:03:16|00:03:20|thinking hey I'm pretty hot stuff I|NA
00:03:18|00:03:20|don't need help I'm gonna do it on my|NA
00:03:20|00:03:23|own|NA
00:03:20|00:03:24|I don't need my aunts help I don't need|NA
00:03:23|00:03:26|my uncle's help or some distant|NA
00:03:24|00:03:29|relatives help you I'm just gonna do|NA
00:03:26|00:03:31|this on my own I can get A's on tests on|NA
00:03:29|00:03:32|my own I just need to work a little bit|NA
00:03:31|00:03:35|harder and I'm going to have a little|NA
00:03:32|00:03:37|bit of self respect for myself and like|NA
00:03:35|00:03:38|most self-respecting Atos I'm just going|NA
00:03:37|00:03:40|to do this on my own|NA
00:03:38|00:03:43|and that's really not the way that this|NA
00:03:40|00:03:45|works and I remember when I was starting|NA
00:03:43|00:03:47|out and I had no experience and nobody|NA
00:03:45|00:03:49|could vouch for me it was very very|NA
00:03:47|00:03:51|difficult for me to get my first|NA
00:03:49|00:03:53|technical job and I didn't want to ask|NA
00:03:51|00:03:55|anybody for help I didn't really know my|NA
00:03:53|00:03:57|relatives that well my aunt was a|NA
00:03:55|00:03:59|director at the tech company I didn't|NA
00:03:57|00:04:01|want to bother her but she heard I was|NA
00:03:59|00:04:03|looking for a job put in a good word for|NA
00:04:01|00:04:05|me and I managed to get one summer|NA
00:04:03|00:04:07|internship out of that at the tech|NA
00:04:05|00:04:09|company that was juniper Networks and|NA
00:04:07|00:04:12|you may be thinking well yeah fine you|NA
00:04:09|00:04:14|got one small little stupid internship|NA
00:04:12|00:04:16|at the tech company you know who cares|NA
00:04:14|00:04:18|right that's not that big of a deal but|NA
00:04:16|00:04:20|what happened was I kept building on|NA
00:04:18|00:04:24|that and that one little piece angled my|NA
00:04:20|00:04:26|trajectory upwards such that my next job|NA
00:04:24|00:04:27|after that what they saw that I had this|NA
00:04:26|00:04:29|tech internship|NA
00:04:27|00:04:31|and I could just get an internship at|NA
00:04:29|00:04:33|like Microsoft after that if I tried to|NA
00:04:31|00:04:35|apply for say getting Microsoft|NA
00:04:33|00:04:37|intership straight away maybe I wouldn't|NA
00:04:35|00:04:38|have been able to do it if I didn't have|NA
00:04:37|00:04:40|that tech internship maybe I wouldn't|NA
00:04:38|00:04:43|have had any of what I currently have|NA
00:04:40|00:04:45|you know maybe I would just be like a|NA
00:04:43|00:04:46|school system administrator or something|NA
00:04:45|00:04:49|like you know they say that beginnings|NA
00:04:46|00:04:50|are very fragile very delicate and they|NA
00:04:49|00:04:53|say that some of the biggest decisions|NA
00:04:50|00:04:55|in your life are the smallest choices so|NA
00:04:53|00:04:57|just angling your career trajectory a|NA
00:04:55|00:04:59|little bit upwards give me that small|NA
00:04:57|00:05:02|little boost can over time lead you into|NA
00:04:59|00:05:04|that light of success instead of going|NA
00:05:02|00:05:07|down just a very plain mediocre Road and|NA
00:05:04|00:05:09|now looking back I think that referrals|NA
00:05:07|00:05:11|are very important I got a referral I|NA
00:05:09|00:05:12|know a lot of other people who got|NA
00:05:11|00:05:14|referrals and you know these people|NA
00:05:12|00:05:16|don't necessarily need to know you super|NA
00:05:14|00:05:18|well and you don't necessarily need to|NA
00:05:16|00:05:20|be applying for like a really good role|NA
00:05:18|00:05:22|but just having a little bit of help|NA
00:05:20|00:05:25|having the humility to accept that help|NA
00:05:22|00:05:26|I think will go a long way and there's|NA
00:05:25|00:05:29|nothing to be ashamed about I would|NA
00:05:26|00:05:32|encourage you to ask around find out who|NA
00:05:29|00:05:34|in your circle or even outer circle may|NA
00:05:32|00:05:36|be working at some company that you're|NA
00:05:34|00:05:37|interested in and just try to get a|NA
00:05:36|00:05:39|referral from that person you know even|NA
00:05:37|00:05:41|like a summer internship or something|NA
00:05:39|00:05:42|like that it's going to help you a lot|NA
00:05:41|00:05:45|the second tip I have for you is to just|NA
00:05:42|00:05:47|make sure that you're applying I know a|NA
00:05:45|00:05:48|lot of people just get discouraged they|NA
00:05:47|00:05:51|don't apply anymore after they get the|NA
00:05:48|00:05:53|first rejection or two and it really|NA
00:05:51|00:05:54|hits them they get into a sense of|NA
00:05:53|00:05:56|failure they don't want to fail anymore|NA
00:05:54|00:05:58|they don't want to feel rejected anymore|NA
00:05:56|00:06:01|they feel they don't want to waste other|NA
00:05:58|00:06:02|people's time but I was surprised to see|NA
00:06:01|00:06:05|that some people out there are applying|NA
00:06:02|00:06:06|to like a hundred different jobs and you|NA
00:06:05|00:06:09|know I think this is really the right|NA
00:06:06|00:06:12|attitude to have you know even for me I|NA
00:06:09|00:06:14|might apply to like ten jobs and if I|NA
00:06:12|00:06:15|couldn't get any of those ten I would|NA
00:06:14|00:06:18|just be like yeah forget it I'm just|NA
00:06:15|00:06:19|gonna play video games all summer or|NA
00:06:18|00:06:21|something like that and you have to|NA
00:06:19|00:06:23|remember for me I've failed that the|NA
00:06:21|00:06:26|Google interview process like three|NA
00:06:23|00:06:28|times before I finally got in and it's|NA
00:06:26|00:06:30|not necessarily always going to be your|NA
00:06:28|00:06:32|fault a lot of times it's an issue of|NA
00:06:30|00:06:34|timing not having enough budget to hire|NA
00:06:32|00:06:35|for a certain role it could be that that|NA
00:06:34|00:06:37|you're they're just too many other|NA
00:06:35|00:06:39|highly qualified applicants you know|NA
00:06:37|00:06:41|there may be a whole variety of reasons|NA
00:06:39|00:06:42|so I would encourage you to just|NA
00:06:41|00:06:44|not get too discouraged don't take it|NA
00:06:42|00:06:46|personally and you know just make sure|NA
00:06:44|00:06:48|that you study up learn some interview|NA
00:06:46|00:06:50|tips and tricks' brush up your resume|NA
00:06:48|00:06:52|and just keep applying and see what you|NA
00:06:50|00:06:54|can get I strongly believe in|NA
00:06:52|00:06:56|celebrating a culture of failure and|NA
00:06:54|00:06:58|unfortunately that's not the way a lot|NA
00:06:56|00:07:00|of people are these days they would just|NA
00:06:58|00:07:02|say oh you apply then you failed you|NA
00:07:00|00:07:03|know they'll make fun of you for that|NA
00:07:02|00:07:06|don't let them get to you this is the|NA
00:07:03|00:07:07|way the game is played I also know here|NA
00:07:06|00:07:09|that a lot of the people will read|NA
00:07:07|00:07:12|what's in the news like they'll say oh|NA
00:07:09|00:07:14|Google is you know anti conservative and|NA
00:07:12|00:07:16|they're going to just take this one|NA
00:07:14|00:07:18|point that they read in the news and use|NA
00:07:16|00:07:21|that and say yeah I don't want to apply|NA
00:07:18|00:07:22|to some company because I read this|NA
00:07:21|00:07:25|thing in the news and now it's a big|NA
00:07:22|00:07:26|deal you know in reality I don't think|NA
00:07:25|00:07:28|these are very big deals within the|NA
00:07:26|00:07:30|companies like you know a lot of these|NA
00:07:28|00:07:32|companies are working on a million|NA
00:07:30|00:07:34|different things and then one small|NA
00:07:32|00:07:36|piece gets leaked into the news and then|NA
00:07:34|00:07:38|the news media makes a huge deal out of|NA
00:07:36|00:07:39|it and that everyone thinks that this is|NA
00:07:38|00:07:43|such a big deal but in reality I would|NA
00:07:39|00:07:45|say 99% of the time engineers are just|NA
00:07:43|00:07:46|talking about the tech if you're not|NA
00:07:45|00:07:47|interested in messing around with|NA
00:07:46|00:07:49|politics you don't have to don't let|NA
00:07:47|00:07:52|that just consume you or dissuade you|NA
00:07:49|00:07:54|you know I would recommend first get the|NA
00:07:52|00:07:55|offer and then you can think about you|NA
00:07:54|00:07:57|know I think that a lot of times people|NA
00:07:55|00:07:59|would just look for reasons look for|NA
00:07:57|00:08:02|excuses for how they can not challenge|NA
00:07:59|00:08:04|themselves and you don't want to be that|NA
00:08:02|00:08:05|person you know like a lot of these|NA
00:08:04|00:08:08|things they're not as big as you may be|NA
00:08:05|00:08:11|imagining third common mistake for you|NA
00:08:08|00:08:13|is focusing too much on the tech|NA
00:08:11|00:08:15|especially for technical interviews you|NA
00:08:13|00:08:18|may be thinking that all people care|NA
00:08:15|00:08:19|about is how technical you are how fast|NA
00:08:18|00:08:22|can you solve how efficient are you|NA
00:08:19|00:08:24|what's your time space analysis can you|NA
00:08:22|00:08:26|write the code but I don't think it's|NA
00:08:24|00:08:28|really about that you know in the end|NA
00:08:26|00:08:29|people are human the whole process is|NA
00:08:28|00:08:32|human and so remember to show your|NA
00:08:29|00:08:34|friendly side show a little bit humor I|NA
00:08:32|00:08:36|think humor is always great to have like|NA
00:08:34|00:08:38|some business casual humor if you can go|NA
00:08:36|00:08:40|through the interview process with the|NA
00:08:38|00:08:42|attitude of friendly professionalism|NA
00:08:40|00:08:45|where it looks like you're a pretty|NA
00:08:42|00:08:48|chill person who people might want to|NA
00:08:45|00:08:49|hang out with go to offsides with maybe|NA
00:08:48|00:08:51|just get to know a little bit better a|NA
00:08:49|00:08:53|kind of an interesting person kind of|NA
00:08:51|00:08:54|fun then I think that would be great to|NA
00:08:53|00:08:55|show but if you|NA
00:08:54|00:08:58|and you're just super serious and|NA
00:08:55|00:09:01|nervous and anxious and stressed out and|NA
00:08:58|00:09:03|you ace the entire technical portion but|NA
00:09:01|00:09:05|you just don't seem very friendly you|NA
00:09:03|00:09:06|don't you seem kind of distant kind of|NA
00:09:05|00:09:09|aloof then I think that sometimes|NA
00:09:06|00:09:12|subconsciously interviewers who are|NA
00:09:09|00:09:15|human as well maybe a little bit picky|NA
00:09:12|00:09:17|err you know they may just say yeah I|NA
00:09:15|00:09:18|didn't really like your analysis when in|NA
00:09:17|00:09:20|reality maybe they just felt that your|NA
00:09:18|00:09:22|charisma wasn't quite there if you seem|NA
00:09:20|00:09:24|like a really friendly person the|NA
00:09:22|00:09:26|interviewer will be rooting for you|NA
00:09:24|00:09:27|trying to find ways to help you out find|NA
00:09:26|00:09:29|ways to just make sure that you succeed|NA
00:09:27|00:09:32|maybe just working with you better and|NA
00:09:29|00:09:34|that teamwork skill right it's going to|NA
00:09:32|00:09:36|be great to have great just show tip|NA
00:09:34|00:09:38|number four is not preparing I know a|NA
00:09:36|00:09:39|lot of people don't want to prepare for|NA
00:09:38|00:09:42|technical interviews because they think|NA
00:09:39|00:09:44|it's just garbage is ridiculous and|NA
00:09:42|00:09:46|you're right but that's currently the|NA
00:09:44|00:09:48|way the game is played I would recommend|NA
00:09:46|00:09:50|that you prepare two technical things to|NA
00:09:48|00:09:52|talk about things that are of sufficient|NA
00:09:50|00:09:53|technical death and then two personal|NA
00:09:52|00:09:56|stories about yourself about teamwork|NA
00:09:53|00:09:58|about your behavior personality|NA
00:09:56|00:10:00|leadership communication skills working|NA
00:09:58|00:10:02|with conflict things like that and|NA
00:10:00|00:10:04|throughout the interview which is going|NA
00:10:02|00:10:06|to be several hours long you can just|NA
00:10:04|00:10:09|have at least four stories that you can|NA
00:10:06|00:10:10|refer back to and trust me as you're|NA
00:10:09|00:10:12|talking you're going to find plenty of|NA
00:10:10|00:10:13|opportunities to just bring up stories|NA
00:10:12|00:10:16|like this and just bring the|NA
00:10:13|00:10:18|conversation to these stories which are|NA
00:10:16|00:10:19|supposed to be very well crafted and|NA
00:10:18|00:10:21|you'll be able to get to them you know|NA
00:10:19|00:10:24|don't just think that you'll be able to|NA
00:10:21|00:10:26|instantly think up any story to a|NA
00:10:24|00:10:28|question that I might ask you like you|NA
00:10:26|00:10:30|don't want to be the person who two|NA
00:10:28|00:10:32|hours after the interview you remember|NA
00:10:30|00:10:33|oh I should have talked about this story|NA
00:10:32|00:10:35|that that would have been such a great|NA
00:10:33|00:10:38|story I should have toad have it|NA
00:10:35|00:10:40|prepared beforehand there's nothing more|NA
00:10:38|00:10:43|boring to me than interviewing a college|NA
00:10:40|00:10:46|new grad and when I asked like tell me|NA
00:10:43|00:10:48|about some project that you did they say|NA
00:10:46|00:10:50|they've done no projects but only have|NA
00:10:48|00:10:51|college coursework to talk about so that|NA
00:10:50|00:10:53|I said okay fine|NA
00:10:51|00:10:55|tell me about your compilers project|NA
00:10:53|00:10:57|course and they talked about it and it's|NA
00:10:55|00:10:59|pretty boring it's not very impressive|NA
00:10:57|00:11:00|so I would say that if you're in college|NA
00:10:59|00:11:03|or you don't have much more to show|NA
00:11:00|00:11:05|beyond just your basic coursework or if|NA
00:11:03|00:11:06|you feel that your current selection of|NA
00:11:05|00:11:08|projects is not very interesting then|NA
00:11:06|00:11:10|start thinking about|NA
00:11:08|00:11:12|maybe coming up with some independent|NA
00:11:10|00:11:14|project that you can work on you know it|NA
00:11:12|00:11:15|doesn't really have to be very complex I|NA
00:11:14|00:11:18|would say even just building a simple|NA
00:11:15|00:11:19|client with a back-end and communication|NA
00:11:18|00:11:22|between the client and back-end through|NA
00:11:19|00:11:23|some API service is going to be already|NA
00:11:22|00:11:25|very good to talk about you know|NA
00:11:23|00:11:27|sometimes that's all I'm really looking|NA
00:11:25|00:11:28|for and very few people seem to even|NA
00:11:27|00:11:30|have experience like this and what I|NA
00:11:28|00:11:32|want to talk about is like how did you|NA
00:11:30|00:11:34|define the API what was the|NA
00:11:32|00:11:36|communication mechanism did you use JSON|NA
00:11:34|00:11:39|XML how did the client get the data back|NA
00:11:36|00:11:41|how did they use that data what language|NA
00:11:39|00:11:43|was the server written in what technical|NA
00:11:41|00:11:44|challenges there were if you can come up|NA
00:11:43|00:11:46|with stores like this that's going to be|NA
00:11:44|00:11:48|really great to talk about within the|NA
00:11:46|00:11:49|first 10 minutes of the interview say|NA
00:11:48|00:11:50|before the technical whiteboarding|NA
00:11:49|00:11:53|begins|NA
00:11:50|00:11:56|tip number five for you is spending all|NA
00:11:53|00:11:58|of your time on one problem if I ask one|NA
00:11:56|00:12:00|problem I sometimes see that people will|NA
00:11:58|00:12:02|spend the whole time working on that one|NA
00:12:00|00:12:04|problem and assume that that was the|NA
00:12:02|00:12:05|only question that has for you whereas|NA
00:12:04|00:12:07|in reality I had the follow-up question|NA
00:12:05|00:12:09|to that and then I had the second|NA
00:12:07|00:12:10|question I wanted to actually get to and|NA
00:12:09|00:12:12|that would have been the main question|NA
00:12:10|00:12:14|so try to plow through these questions|NA
00:12:12|00:12:16|quicker if you can so remember that even|NA
00:12:14|00:12:19|if you get the problem entirely correct|NA
00:12:16|00:12:20|if you were just really slow and it took|NA
00:12:19|00:12:23|you 30 minutes just to get through that|NA
00:12:20|00:12:26|first portion of the question that's not|NA
00:12:23|00:12:27|going to be enough make sure that you're|NA
00:12:26|00:12:29|working fast and you're keeping an eye|NA
00:12:27|00:12:31|on time but that time is very important|NA
00:12:29|00:12:33|and you want to pack in as much content|NA
00:12:31|00:12:35|into that time as you can to demonstrate|NA
00:12:33|00:12:37|how much you can get through that|NA
00:12:35|00:12:40|productivity efficiency factor is|NA
00:12:37|00:12:42|something to really consider the sixth|NA
00:12:40|00:12:44|tip I have for you is for technical|NA
00:12:42|00:12:46|interviews to remember to write the code|NA
00:12:44|00:12:48|don't just think that all you have to do|NA
00:12:46|00:12:51|is hand wave because people actually|NA
00:12:48|00:12:53|want to see you be able to code see the|NA
00:12:51|00:12:56|code is good too it's fine but sometimes|NA
00:12:53|00:12:58|mix in some real code with semicolons|NA
00:12:56|00:13:00|and variables and all that stuff just so|NA
00:12:58|00:13:02|that you can satisfy those hard core|NA
00:13:00|00:13:03|engineers some of them just want to make|NA
00:13:02|00:13:05|sure that you can actually code and|NA
00:13:03|00:13:07|remember that has come in these days for|NA
00:13:05|00:13:10|people to take a picture of the code|NA
00:13:07|00:13:12|that you wrote at the end that is used|NA
00:13:10|00:13:13|as a record and what I've know this is a|NA
00:13:12|00:13:15|lot of the people can hand wave talk|NA
00:13:13|00:13:17|about what a solution might look like|NA
00:13:15|00:13:20|but until you can actually put the code|NA
00:13:17|00:13:22|down the credit that you get for that is|NA
00:13:20|00:13:24|not going to be as significant|NA
00:13:22|00:13:25|as it should be to be extra clear just|NA
00:13:24|00:13:27|make sure that you put the coat down|NA
00:13:25|00:13:29|onto the wall along with this I want to|NA
00:13:27|00:13:31|remind you to make sure that your resume|NA
00:13:29|00:13:33|is also very clear about the projects|NA
00:13:31|00:13:35|that you've done when I write feedback|NA
00:13:33|00:13:38|for a candidate I will often use the|NA
00:13:35|00:13:40|resume as a reference to remember what|NA
00:13:38|00:13:42|we talked about and if I'm reading your|NA
00:13:40|00:13:43|resume and it's usually a bunch of|NA
00:13:42|00:13:45|technical mumbo-jumbo|NA
00:13:43|00:13:47|and I can't figure out what you actually|NA
00:13:45|00:13:49|did and I don't remember and if your|NA
00:13:47|00:13:53|resume just said utilize|NA
00:13:49|00:13:55|enterprise-class Java Ajax Hyperion|NA
00:13:53|00:13:57|technical note interfaces to integrate|NA
00:13:55|00:13:58|quantum-mechanical artificial|NA
00:13:57|00:14:00|intelligence well that sounds really|NA
00:13:58|00:14:02|great but I really have no idea whether|NA
00:14:00|00:14:03|it was and I'm not going to put that|NA
00:14:02|00:14:05|into the feedback because I don't even|NA
00:14:03|00:14:08|know what it was about the seventh tip I|NA
00:14:05|00:14:09|have for you is not focusing on analysis|NA
00:14:08|00:14:11|enough a lot of people are really eager|NA
00:14:09|00:14:14|to code really eager to just start|NA
00:14:11|00:14:16|writing stuff they don't teach you|NA
00:14:14|00:14:18|analysis as much as they should in|NA
00:14:16|00:14:20|college but the first thing to do is|NA
00:14:18|00:14:22|really to analyze and talk through what|NA
00:14:20|00:14:24|your solution may look like talk about|NA
00:14:22|00:14:26|that time space analysis otherwise what|NA
00:14:24|00:14:28|are you even writing right what are we|NA
00:14:26|00:14:31|even coding here is this even going to|NA
00:14:28|00:14:32|work you know and then sometimes I see|NA
00:14:31|00:14:34|people just start writing their|NA
00:14:32|00:14:36|recursion right in there for loops and|NA
00:14:34|00:14:38|just like what is this what is this even|NA
00:14:36|00:14:40|supposed to be didn't we think about|NA
00:14:38|00:14:42|this or are we just starting to code|NA
00:14:40|00:14:44|here not all companies but some|NA
00:14:42|00:14:47|companies will actually first write a|NA
00:14:44|00:14:49|design dog evaluating the alternatives|NA
00:14:47|00:14:51|before they actually start writing code|NA
00:14:49|00:14:53|if you just start writing code you're|NA
00:14:51|00:14:55|kind of doing things backwards in some|NA
00:14:53|00:14:57|scenarios I have one more bonus tip for|NA
00:14:55|00:14:59|you which is to enjoy your lunch you|NA
00:14:57|00:15:02|know this is your one chance to go pick|NA
00:14:59|00:15:04|out at the cafeteria so I recommend just|NA
00:15:02|00:15:06|eating as much as you like you know it's|NA
00:15:04|00:15:08|a buffet save your appetite for it and|NA
00:15:06|00:15:10|when you're done eating ask for dessert|NA
00:15:08|00:15:12|you know don't be shy about it just be|NA
00:15:10|00:15:14|like yeah I want two desserts I'm just|NA
00:15:12|00:15:17|gonna go eat like all of this stuff and|NA
00:15:14|00:15:19|then when the interviewer asks you on|NA
00:15:17|00:15:21|your way out like if you want drink yeah|NA
00:15:19|00:15:23|go grab a drink sample some of the|NA
00:15:21|00:15:25|snacks sample some of the food grab a|NA
00:15:23|00:15:27|drink try things out a lot of people|NA
00:15:25|00:15:29|seem to just get boring water and I just|NA
00:15:27|00:15:32|think it's kind of wasted like I think|NA
00:15:29|00:15:34|it's great I would do with FRU my last|NA
00:15:32|00:15:36|and final tip and the best tip of all is|NA
00:15:34|00:15:37|a lot of people don't prepare them|NA
00:15:36|00:15:39|fundamentally they don't learn they|NA
00:15:37|00:15:41|don't have that technical knowledge and|NA
00:15:39|00:15:44|you can get that for yourself by|NA
00:15:41|00:15:46|checking out brilliant org this is a|NA
00:15:44|00:15:48|great website for learning computer|NA
00:15:46|00:15:50|science fundamentals algorithms|NA
00:15:48|00:15:52|mathematics probability statistics and a|NA
00:15:50|00:15:54|lot of fun because you can go through|NA
00:15:52|00:15:56|various problem sets there are problems|NA
00:15:54|00:15:58|and solutions with thorough explanations|NA
00:15:56|00:16:00|and there are a wide variety of topics|NA
00:15:58|00:16:02|so you can focus on whichever area that|NA
00:16:00|00:16:03|you feel you need more help on I might|NA
00:16:02|00:16:06|also recommend for you to check out|NA
00:16:03|00:16:08|their statistics or probability section|NA
00:16:06|00:16:10|anytime a candidate that comes to me and|NA
00:16:08|00:16:12|starts busting out their statistics and|NA
00:16:10|00:16:14|probability skills I'm usually pretty|NA
00:16:12|00:16:16|impressed even if they're computer|NA
00:16:14|00:16:17|science core fundamentals are not that|NA
00:16:16|00:16:19|strong|NA
00:16:17|00:16:22|I might still say well hey they seem to|NA
00:16:19|00:16:24|have really good analytical skills for|NA
00:16:22|00:16:26|probability and statistics you know|NA
00:16:24|00:16:28|every company is very metric space these|NA
00:16:26|00:16:29|days they use a lot of this stuff and so|NA
00:16:28|00:16:31|if you expand your knowledge out into|NA
00:16:29|00:16:33|other areas and then mention that in the|NA
00:16:31|00:16:36|interviews I think that can also reflect|NA
00:16:33|00:16:39|positively for you so that'll for me let|NA
00:16:36|00:16:41|me know if you have any tips for common|NA
00:16:39|00:16:42|mistakes people make in interviews if|NA
00:16:41|00:16:47|you liked the video give it a like and|NA
00:16:42|00:16:47|subscribe and I'll see you next time bye|NA
