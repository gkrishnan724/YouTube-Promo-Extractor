00:00:03|00:00:10|this video is sponsored by the great|NA
00:00:06|00:00:11|courses class I made a video a while|NA
00:00:10|00:00:14|back and called a better description of|NA
00:00:11|00:00:16|entropy because I felt that the bug|NA
00:00:14|00:00:18|standard description of entropy wasn't|NA
00:00:16|00:00:20|great and I thought I could be better it|NA
00:00:18|00:00:22|was a really fun video to make so I|NA
00:00:20|00:00:23|thought it could become a series and|NA
00:00:22|00:00:26|this is the next one a better|NA
00:00:23|00:00:27|description of resonance the Volks|NA
00:00:26|00:00:28|standard description of resonance go|NA
00:00:27|00:00:30|something like this|NA
00:00:28|00:00:33|if you ping a wineglass or pluck a|NA
00:00:30|00:00:36|guitar string then the note that you|NA
00:00:33|00:00:39|hear is the frequency that that object|NA
00:00:36|00:00:41|likes to vibrate at it's that object|NA
00:00:39|00:00:44|favorite frequency is the resonant|NA
00:00:41|00:00:46|frequency of that object mass resonance|NA
00:00:44|00:00:49|it's okay as a description but I think I|NA
00:00:46|00:00:51|can do better the best way I found to|NA
00:00:49|00:00:54|describe resonances using this thing|NA
00:00:51|00:00:56|it's called a Rubens tube it's a hollow|NA
00:00:54|00:00:58|aluminium tube at one end it's blocked|NA
00:00:56|00:01:00|off with a piece of wood at the other|NA
00:00:58|00:01:04|end it's blocked off with rubber|NA
00:01:00|00:01:06|membrane and if I tap that membrane with|NA
00:01:04|00:01:08|my finger then that will send a pulse of|NA
00:01:06|00:01:10|pressure through the tube traveling at|NA
00:01:08|00:01:13|the speed of sound when the pulse|NA
00:01:10|00:01:14|reaches this end some of it gets|NA
00:01:13|00:01:18|reflected and it travels back through|NA
00:01:14|00:01:19|the tube to here and then when the pulse|NA
00:01:18|00:01:22|gets to here some of it gets reflected|NA
00:01:19|00:01:25|and it travels back in this direction so|NA
00:01:22|00:01:27|when I tap the rubber membrane a pulse|NA
00:01:25|00:01:30|of pressure bounces backwards and|NA
00:01:27|00:01:31|forwards inside the tube getting weaker|NA
00:01:30|00:01:35|and weaker and weaker until eventually|NA
00:01:31|00:01:38|it fades away to nothing but what if I|NA
00:01:35|00:01:41|repeatedly tap without remembering so I|NA
00:01:38|00:01:44|tap the rubber the pulse passes to the|NA
00:01:41|00:01:46|tube it bounces off here it comes back|NA
00:01:44|00:01:49|to here just as it reaches this side I|NA
00:01:46|00:01:50|pass the membrane again and now the|NA
00:01:49|00:01:52|pulse is even bigger than it was before|NA
00:01:50|00:01:55|because I've added to it so now a larger|NA
00:01:52|00:01:56|pulse is traveling through the tube it|NA
00:01:55|00:01:58|bounced back gets to here just when it|NA
00:01:56|00:02:01|gets to here I tap it a third time and|NA
00:01:58|00:02:03|that of course is even bigger again and|NA
00:02:01|00:02:05|if I keep doing that if I keep tapping|NA
00:02:03|00:02:07|the rubber membrane at just the right|NA
00:02:05|00:02:10|time the pulse will get bigger and|NA
00:02:07|00:02:14|bigger and bigger and that's resonance|NA
00:02:10|00:02:18|resonance is game with timing just right|NA
00:02:14|00:02:20|getting the frequency just right so that|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|the energy you put into the system adds|NA
00:02:20|00:02:26|to the energy that's already there|NA
00:02:22|00:02:30|that's resonance so the frequency of|NA
00:02:26|00:02:33|taps that I need to learn to get that's|NA
00:02:30|00:02:35|the resonant frequency of the column of|NA
00:02:33|00:02:38|air inside this tube but it's not the|NA
00:02:35|00:02:40|only resonant frequency of the column of|NA
00:02:38|00:02:43|air there are infinitely many so for|NA
00:02:40|00:02:45|example if I tap the rubber membrane and|NA
00:02:43|00:02:47|a pulse goes into the tube and then I|NA
00:02:45|00:02:48|tap it a second time so now there are|NA
00:02:47|00:02:51|two pulses inside the tube that they|NA
00:02:48|00:02:54|cross over like this and then the third|NA
00:02:51|00:02:57|tab happens when the first tap gets back|NA
00:02:54|00:03:00|or I could tap the remote membrane twice|NA
00:02:57|00:03:02|so you know one goes in and illiberal|NA
00:03:00|00:03:05|goes in there maybe and then a third one|NA
00:03:02|00:03:08|goes in like that and then the fourth|NA
00:03:05|00:03:10|tap doesn't happen until the first one|NA
00:03:08|00:03:12|gets back but I'm still getting this|NA
00:03:10|00:03:14|timing just right so that the energy I|NA
00:03:12|00:03:16|put in adds to the energy that's already|NA
00:03:14|00:03:19|there it's just that I've waited for a|NA
00:03:16|00:03:21|couple of taps to go in first so what's|NA
00:03:19|00:03:23|that like when you've got pulses coming|NA
00:03:21|00:03:24|in from this direction and the reflected|NA
00:03:23|00:03:27|pulses coming back and they're crossing|NA
00:03:24|00:03:30|over each other it looks like this so|NA
00:03:27|00:03:33|the waves coming from both directions|NA
00:03:30|00:03:36|they cross over each other and they add|NA
00:03:33|00:03:38|together and when you add them together|NA
00:03:36|00:03:41|you get something called a standing wave|NA
00:03:38|00:03:42|where you have nodes and antinodes the|NA
00:03:41|00:03:43|nodes are the points where there's no|NA
00:03:42|00:03:46|movement and the anti nodes are the|NA
00:03:43|00:03:48|points where there's lots of movement so|NA
00:03:46|00:03:51|how fast do I need to tap this membrane|NA
00:03:48|00:03:53|to see the effect well much faster than|NA
00:03:51|00:03:55|I can tap with my finger in fact it's an|NA
00:03:53|00:03:58|audible frequency so instead of using my|NA
00:03:55|00:04:00|finger I'll attach a speaker to the end|NA
00:03:58|00:04:03|like this|NA
00:04:00|00:04:06|so if I can drive the speaker at the|NA
00:04:03|00:04:08|resonating frequency of this tube then|NA
00:04:06|00:04:10|the energy that I put into the system|NA
00:04:08|00:04:13|adds to the energy that's already there|NA
00:04:10|00:04:15|and we should hear that as an increase|NA
00:04:13|00:04:19|in the amplitude of the sound we should|NA
00:04:15|00:04:23|hear the volume go up so let's try that|NA
00:04:19|00:04:26|okay so this isn't one of the resonating|NA
00:04:23|00:04:31|frequencies of the tube if I just bump|NA
00:04:26|00:04:34|up the frequency a little bit okay the|NA
00:04:31|00:04:38|volume went up I found the resonating|NA
00:04:34|00:04:41|frequency of this tube this speaker is|NA
00:04:38|00:04:45|tapping the rubber membrane at just the|NA
00:04:41|00:04:48|right speed so that the next tap of the|NA
00:04:45|00:04:52|speaker is meeting one of the returning|NA
00:04:48|00:04:53|pulses from this end and we're adding to|NA
00:04:52|00:04:56|the energy that's stored in the system|NA
00:04:53|00:04:57|that's resonance the problem is you|NA
00:04:56|00:05:01|can't really see what's happening|NA
00:04:57|00:05:07|because it's happening inside the tube|NA
00:05:01|00:05:10|and air is invisible which is why the|NA
00:05:07|00:05:12|Rubens tube is designed to be set on|NA
00:05:10|00:05:14|fire before I say anything on fire I've|NA
00:05:12|00:05:16|actually switched out the Rubens tube|NA
00:05:14|00:05:19|the first one I showed you is when I|NA
00:05:16|00:05:21|built myself and it was awhile ago and I|NA
00:05:19|00:05:23|didn't know what I was doing and it's a|NA
00:05:21|00:05:24|little bit worse for wear so I wasn't|NA
00:05:23|00:05:26|comfortable saying that when I wear this|NA
00:05:24|00:05:28|is one that I bought the only problem|NA
00:05:26|00:05:30|with this one is that the speaker|NA
00:05:28|00:05:31|assembly is completely enclosed and I|NA
00:05:30|00:05:34|really want to show you the rubber|NA
00:05:31|00:05:36|membrane and the hole tapping thing with|NA
00:05:34|00:05:39|this one I'm comfortable setting on fire|NA
00:05:36|00:05:42|so we pump in butane through here and|NA
00:05:39|00:05:45|then we set like to it the first thing|NA
00:05:42|00:05:47|you have to do is fill the tube with|NA
00:05:45|00:05:51|butane basically you have to get past|NA
00:05:47|00:05:53|fifteen percent butane because that's a|NA
00:05:51|00:05:56|dangerous mixture it's a stoichiometric|NA
00:05:53|00:06:01|ratio and it's explosive so we just have|NA
00:05:56|00:06:03|to make sure we get I can smell|NA
00:06:01|00:06:03|percentages|NA
00:06:17|00:06:21|[Music]|NA
00:06:26|00:06:29|[Music]|NA
00:06:30|00:06:38|so hopefully you can see the results of|NA
00:06:35|00:06:43|the standing wave in the flames so these|NA
00:06:38|00:06:46|points are the nodes here and here these|NA
00:06:43|00:06:48|are the anti nodes so these points|NA
00:06:46|00:06:50|there's the nose where the flames are|NA
00:06:48|00:06:53|small those are the points where the|NA
00:06:50|00:06:55|pressure isn't very very much at that|NA
00:06:53|00:06:58|point the tall flames|NA
00:06:55|00:07:00|those are the anti nodes those are the|NA
00:06:58|00:07:03|points where the pressure is varying a|NA
00:07:00|00:07:08|lot at that point and let's see if we|NA
00:07:03|00:07:12|can find some higher ones I swept|NA
00:07:08|00:07:12|through a few then at C we go|NA
00:07:14|00:07:24|[Music]|NA
00:07:27|00:07:34|[Music]|NA
00:07:47|00:07:54|[Music]|NA
00:07:50|00:07:56|and that is the Rubens tube so what's|NA
00:07:54|00:07:58|all this got to do with the sound that|NA
00:07:56|00:08:00|something makes when you hit it or pluck|NA
00:07:58|00:08:02|it all blow over it well any scenario|NA
00:08:00|00:08:04|like that you come across needs its own|NA
00:08:02|00:08:06|explanation so let's look at one|NA
00:08:04|00:08:08|particular example let's look at wind|NA
00:08:06|00:08:10|instruments so I've got my wind|NA
00:08:08|00:08:12|instrument here it's a bottle and I've|NA
00:08:10|00:08:15|filled it with water and I can blow over|NA
00:08:12|00:08:17|the neck like this mmm when I do that I|NA
00:08:15|00:08:20|get a nice note so why does that happen|NA
00:08:17|00:08:21|and how does it relate to resonance so|NA
00:08:20|00:08:24|when you make that noise with your|NA
00:08:21|00:08:27|manners that kind of noise that's white|NA
00:08:24|00:08:30|noise and you may have heard white noise|NA
00:08:27|00:08:33|being described as a mixture of all|NA
00:08:30|00:08:35|frequencies within a range at the same|NA
00:08:33|00:08:37|time so when you get that kind of|NA
00:08:35|00:08:39|hissing whooshing sound it's a whole|NA
00:08:37|00:08:41|range of frequencies all jumbled up|NA
00:08:39|00:08:44|together so when you blow over the neck|NA
00:08:41|00:08:47|of a bottle you're driving the body of|NA
00:08:44|00:08:50|air inside at a whole range of|NA
00:08:47|00:08:53|frequencies but because of what we learn|NA
00:08:50|00:08:56|with the Rubens tube it's actually only|NA
00:08:53|00:08:59|the resonant frequencies of the body of|NA
00:08:56|00:09:00|air inside they get amplified and so|NA
00:08:59|00:09:02|those are the ones that you hear|NA
00:09:00|00:09:05|interestingly when you hear a wind|NA
00:09:02|00:09:08|instrument you perceive the lowest|NA
00:09:05|00:09:10|resonating frequency and all the other|NA
00:09:08|00:09:12|frequencies that are being generated|NA
00:09:10|00:09:16|when you blow over the neck of a bottle|NA
00:09:12|00:09:18|like this just add to the timbre of the|NA
00:09:16|00:09:22|sound they don't change the perceived|NA
00:09:18|00:09:25|pitch of the sound so the quality|NA
00:09:22|00:09:27|changes the timbre changes depending on|NA
00:09:25|00:09:32|the balance of the resonating|NA
00:09:27|00:09:34|frequencies that are generated and it's|NA
00:09:32|00:09:36|this balance that helps us to|NA
00:09:34|00:09:39|distinguish one instrument from another|NA
00:09:36|00:09:43|the case of guitar string being plucked|NA
00:09:39|00:09:47|is a bit more it is a guitar actually|NA
00:09:43|00:09:49|I'm just massive the case of a guitar|NA
00:09:47|00:09:52|string being plucked is a bit more|NA
00:09:49|00:09:55|complicated it involves things like|NA
00:09:52|00:09:57|Fourier analysis and stuff like that|NA
00:09:55|00:10:00|it's really interesting and I may cover|NA
00:09:57|00:10:01|it in a future video but for now I'm|NA
00:10:00|00:10:04|going to leave you|NA
