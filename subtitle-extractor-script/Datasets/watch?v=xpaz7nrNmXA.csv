00:00:37|00:00:43|basic tips to up your game one thing to|NA
00:00:40|00:00:45|know is that the technical resume is|NA
00:00:43|00:00:46|very different than the normal resume|NA
00:00:45|00:00:47|there are few things are different that|NA
00:00:46|00:00:49|if you're new to the game you're not|NA
00:00:47|00:00:52|going to know about so I've seen|NA
00:00:49|00:00:53|hundreds of resumes myself and I feel|NA
00:00:52|00:00:55|that I can just give you a few basic|NA
00:00:53|00:00:56|pointers to help you guys get going now|A
00:00:55|00:00:59|the first thing to know is that this|A
00:00:56|00:01:01|video is sponsored by brilliant org so|A
00:00:59|00:01:03|check them out they're an educational|A
00:01:01|00:01:05|website they make learning fun with very|A
00:01:03|00:01:07|experienced educators check out their|A
00:01:05|00:01:09|website I brilliant that org slash tech|A
00:01:07|00:01:10|lead okay so the other thing I want to|NA
00:01:09|00:01:13|know is that I'm not a recruiter|NA
00:01:10|00:01:15|okay so recruiters are often the|NA
00:01:13|00:01:16|gatekeepers into a company they're|NA
00:01:15|00:01:18|perhaps the number one audience for your|NA
00:01:16|00:01:20|resume since I'm not a recruiter|NA
00:01:18|00:01:22|I don't really know necessarily what|NA
00:01:20|00:01:24|they're looking for what their sides if|NA
00:01:22|00:01:25|the picture is but there are a number of|NA
00:01:24|00:01:27|people who view your resume I would say|NA
00:01:25|00:01:29|about three different people the first|NA
00:01:27|00:01:31|group are the recruiters after that the|NA
00:01:29|00:01:33|resume goes into the hiring manager|NA
00:01:31|00:01:34|sometimes the hiring manager has a lot|NA
00:01:33|00:01:35|of experience might take a look at your|NA
00:01:34|00:01:37|resume and decide whether to bring you|NA
00:01:35|00:01:39|on site then there's a third group the|NA
00:01:37|00:01:41|group I belong to I'm just another|NA
00:01:39|00:01:43|interviewer I'm the engineer that|NA
00:01:41|00:01:44|developer your colleague I conduct the|NA
00:01:43|00:01:45|interview everyone's looking for|NA
00:01:44|00:01:47|different things so you need to craft|NA
00:01:45|00:01:49|your resume kind of for three different|NA
00:01:47|00:01:51|audiences and you need to be able to hit|NA
00:01:49|00:01:53|all of them one key thing to note is|NA
00:01:51|00:01:55|that in tech there's so many resumes|NA
00:01:53|00:01:57|hundreds of millions of resumes actually|NA
00:01:55|00:01:59|in order to really process them people|NA
00:01:57|00:02:01|use filters so that's the number one|NA
00:01:59|00:02:02|make sure that your resume is easily|NA
00:02:01|00:02:04|searchable you're hitting those keywords|NA
00:02:02|00:02:06|a lot of people will be doing this the|NA
00:02:04|00:02:08|tech resume often has the skills and|NA
00:02:06|00:02:11|languages section that just lists a|NA
00:02:08|00:02:13|bunch of keywords like C++ Java|NA
00:02:11|00:02:16|JavaScript my sequel Python|NA
00:02:13|00:02:18|PHP objective-c swith Android iOS|NA
00:02:16|00:02:20|angular Kotlin just a whole bunch of|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|different technologies that you think a|NA
00:02:20|00:02:24|recruiter may be looking for as they're|NA
00:02:22|00:02:26|trying to filter for a candidate for|NA
00:02:24|00:02:28|specific role the section is generally|NA
00:02:26|00:02:29|prioritized from the most experienced to|NA
00:02:28|00:02:31|the least experienced and this is|NA
00:02:29|00:02:33|something that I used to include in my|NA
00:02:31|00:02:36|resume as well but we'll see in a moment|NA
00:02:33|00:02:37|why I actually decided to remove the|NA
00:02:36|00:02:39|skills and languages section from my|NA
00:02:37|00:02:43|resume and I'll tell you why in a moment|NA
00:02:39|00:02:45|the second tip is remember that less is|NA
00:02:43|00:02:47|more I strongly recommend that you keep|NA
00:02:45|00:02:49|your resume to just one page the reason|NA
00:02:47|00:02:51|is that when I'm sitting across from you|NA
00:02:49|00:02:53|interviewing I have your resume either|NA
00:02:51|00:02:55|in front of me that's one page and I'm|NA
00:02:53|00:02:57|not going to be flipping through all the|NA
00:02:55|00:02:59|time I mean sometimes I will be but it's|NA
00:02:57|00:03:01|better if there's just one page with a|NA
00:02:59|00:03:03|concise list of things that we can talk|NA
00:03:01|00:03:04|about that presents the best version of|NA
00:03:03|00:03:07|you it's just your highlights and you'll|NA
00:03:04|00:03:09|find that I think like even Steve Jobs|NA
00:03:07|00:03:11|just had a one-page resume you know like|NA
00:03:09|00:03:13|how many pages do you really need take|NA
00:03:11|00:03:15|just the best highlights and just show|NA
00:03:13|00:03:17|that be concise and cut out anything|NA
00:03:15|00:03:19|that you think doesn't really help your|NA
00:03:17|00:03:21|case many things can actually make you|NA
00:03:19|00:03:23|look worse like listing things like you|NA
00:03:21|00:03:26|got certification level two in Microsoft|NA
00:03:23|00:03:28|Excel may actually show that your lower|NA
00:03:26|00:03:29|level than what you should be at because|NA
00:03:28|00:03:32|you had to actually go through all the|NA
00:03:29|00:03:33|steps to get that certification I would|NA
00:03:32|00:03:35|say it's also okay to leave out certain|NA
00:03:33|00:03:37|positions certain projects that you feel|NA
00:03:35|00:03:39|don't really add to your case you know|NA
00:03:37|00:03:41|like if you're an uber driver it's a lot|NA
00:03:39|00:03:43|like photography everyone can take a|NA
00:03:41|00:03:45|good picture but the good photographers|NA
00:03:43|00:03:48|know which picture is good and they only|NA
00:03:45|00:03:50|show that tip number three is in my|NA
00:03:48|00:03:52|opinion the less formatting the better a|NA
00:03:50|00:03:54|lot of really good tech resumes that|NA
00:03:52|00:03:56|I've seen look very similar to my resume|NA
00:03:54|00:03:58|I'll show my resume later on and you can|NA
00:03:56|00:04:00|just copy that format but once you start|NA
00:03:58|00:04:02|getting really creative and doing a|NA
00:04:00|00:04:04|bunch of different stuff like putting|NA
00:04:02|00:04:06|your photo on there using multi-column|NA
00:04:04|00:04:08|layouts you see italics crazy fonts|NA
00:04:06|00:04:10|charts pictures you know just starts|NA
00:04:08|00:04:12|looking like amateur hour and it starts|NA
00:04:10|00:04:13|showing that maybe you're an insecure|NA
00:04:12|00:04:15|person you're trying to hide something|NA
00:04:13|00:04:18|maybe you're trying to distract me|NA
00:04:15|00:04:20|without those flashy colors people who|NA
00:04:18|00:04:22|review resumes review hundreds of|NA
00:04:20|00:04:24|millions of them per hour and they've|NA
00:04:22|00:04:26|developed a high sense of cynicism so|NA
00:04:24|00:04:27|just show the facts also I would say|NA
00:04:26|00:04:29|that a lot of these resumes gets|NA
00:04:27|00:04:32|anyway and you want your resume to be|NA
00:04:29|00:04:34|scanner friendly so for me I limit|NA
00:04:32|00:04:35|myself to just using both phones to|NA
00:04:34|00:04:38|highlight a few things that I think are|NA
00:04:35|00:04:39|worthy italics are here don't stand very|NA
00:04:38|00:04:42|well I would also recommend that you|NA
00:04:39|00:04:44|export your resume in PDF format|NA
00:04:42|00:04:47|a lot of people send me their resume in|NA
00:04:44|00:04:48|Microsoft words dot docx format and|NA
00:04:47|00:04:50|that's struggle to try to open that and|NA
00:04:48|00:04:52|right off the bat my first impression is|NA
00:04:50|00:04:54|you don't really know what you're doing|NA
00:04:52|00:04:55|you don't understand your audience you|NA
00:04:54|00:04:57|know you've delivered the format to me|NA
00:04:55|00:04:59|that is just not really widely used one|NA
00:04:57|00:05:02|easy way to do this is you go into|NA
00:04:59|00:05:05|Google Docs write your document export|NA
00:05:02|00:05:07|as PDF and that's what I do tip number|NA
00:05:05|00:05:08|four is to try to avoid exaggerating too|NA
00:05:07|00:05:09|much|NA
00:05:08|00:05:10|it is a real turnoff when I'm|NA
00:05:09|00:05:13|interviewing somebody and I can tell|NA
00:05:10|00:05:14|that they're just fronting themselves if|NA
00:05:13|00:05:16|they're doing that I'm going to try and|NA
00:05:14|00:05:18|challenge them I'm going to see if I can|NA
00:05:16|00:05:19|trick them see if I can get them in|NA
00:05:18|00:05:21|their own trap that they've set up for|NA
00:05:19|00:05:23|themselves I want to make them prove|NA
00:05:21|00:05:24|themselves show me that they're really|NA
00:05:23|00:05:26|that good it becomes very clear if|NA
00:05:24|00:05:28|they're just exaggerating they say they|NA
00:05:26|00:05:30|led some project but then when I hear|NA
00:05:28|00:05:32|them talk about it it's not quite like|NA
00:05:30|00:05:34|that you know not every role is looking|NA
00:05:32|00:05:35|for a senior lead you know if you're|NA
00:05:34|00:05:37|fresh out of the college people are|NA
00:05:35|00:05:39|expecting that they know that and the|NA
00:05:37|00:05:40|role is crafted for somebody of that|NA
00:05:39|00:05:42|caliber|NA
00:05:40|00:05:44|that's entry level and that's fine and|NA
00:05:42|00:05:46|for somebody like that it's far better|NA
00:05:44|00:05:48|to look like somebody who is just eager|NA
00:05:46|00:05:49|excited really passionate about learning|NA
00:05:48|00:05:51|they know that they don't know|NA
00:05:49|00:05:53|everything yet they're humble and|NA
00:05:51|00:05:54|they're just really ready to learn|NA
00:05:53|00:05:56|that's great that's somebody that I'm|NA
00:05:54|00:05:58|looking for and stuff somebody who's|NA
00:05:56|00:06:00|coming here trying to act like they're|NA
00:05:58|00:06:02|really smart like they're arrogant like|NA
00:06:00|00:06:04|they know more than they are and it|NA
00:06:02|00:06:05|seems kind of dissing you in' along with|NA
00:06:04|00:06:06|that though i might mention that you|NA
00:06:05|00:06:09|want to generally highlight your|NA
00:06:06|00:06:11|strengths not your weaknesses for myself|NA
00:06:09|00:06:13|for a long time my resume was not|NA
00:06:11|00:06:15|actually in chronological order|NA
00:06:13|00:06:17|I put the projects that I was most proud|NA
00:06:15|00:06:18|of the ones I wanted to talk about the|NA
00:06:17|00:06:21|most the ones that were most technically|NA
00:06:18|00:06:23|interesting at the top of my resume and|NA
00:06:21|00:06:24|I think that's fine you know it doesn't|NA
00:06:23|00:06:27|necessarily have to be in chronological|NA
00:06:24|00:06:29|order tip number five is make sure that|NA
00:06:27|00:06:31|the first two to three items on your|NA
00:06:29|00:06:33|resume are ones that you can talk about|NA
00:06:31|00:06:35|at length for me when I sit down in|NA
00:06:33|00:06:36|front of a candidate I want to talk to|NA
00:06:35|00:06:38|them a little bit and usually I only|NA
00:06:36|00:06:40|read the first say two to three items on|NA
00:06:38|00:06:41|your resume anything after that seems|NA
00:06:40|00:06:43|like old news|NA
00:06:41|00:06:45|and I might just pick the first item on|NA
00:06:43|00:06:46|the resume and ask you to tell me about|NA
00:06:45|00:06:48|it you want to make sure that it's|NA
00:06:46|00:06:51|understandable and doesn't contain too|NA
00:06:48|00:06:53|much crazy technical jargon time after|NA
00:06:51|00:06:55|time I've seen resumes and it's using so|NA
00:06:53|00:06:58|many crazy words like set up the orbits|NA
00:06:55|00:07:00|no decks engine in order to prevent|NA
00:06:58|00:07:02|thruster failure I don't even know what|NA
00:07:00|00:07:03|that means I'm the type of person who|NA
00:07:02|00:07:05|would just say well if I didn't|NA
00:07:03|00:07:06|understand it was your fault you know|NA
00:07:05|00:07:08|you weren't clear enough after it's time|NA
00:07:06|00:07:10|I'm going to try to get you to help|NA
00:07:08|00:07:12|clarify some of this technical garbage|NA
00:07:10|00:07:13|that you've put on your resume but if|NA
00:07:12|00:07:16|there's just too much of it then I just|NA
00:07:13|00:07:17|can't make any sense of it at all one|NA
00:07:16|00:07:21|key thing that everybody is looking for|NA
00:07:17|00:07:23|here is what did you do specifically you|NA
00:07:21|00:07:24|want to make sure that that's clear it's|NA
00:07:23|00:07:26|not about what your team did it's not|NA
00:07:24|00:07:28|about what your company is doing it's|NA
00:07:26|00:07:29|not about what that product is that's|NA
00:07:28|00:07:31|really irrelevant it's about what you|NA
00:07:29|00:07:33|did and resumes contain so much fluff|NA
00:07:31|00:07:36|everyone's always trying to sort through|NA
00:07:33|00:07:39|it to try to figure out ok this project|NA
00:07:36|00:07:41|was cool the team was cool but were you|NA
00:07:39|00:07:43|cool what did you contribute what role|NA
00:07:41|00:07:45|did you play you want to make sure|NA
00:07:43|00:07:49|you're not using really weak verbs like|NA
00:07:45|00:07:51|participated in X helped work on Y took|NA
00:07:49|00:07:53|part in Z you want to use words like|NA
00:07:51|00:07:56|implemented developed launched|NA
00:07:53|00:08:00|architected led designed things like|NA
00:07:56|00:08:03|that tip number six is get some feedback|NA
00:08:00|00:08:05|for your resume it's funny that in my|NA
00:08:03|00:08:07|first few years I didn't let anybody see|NA
00:08:05|00:08:08|my resume that was private I didn't want|NA
00:08:07|00:08:10|my friends seeing it I didn't want my|NA
00:08:08|00:08:12|family seeing it you know this was|NA
00:08:10|00:08:12|something that was too close to who I|NA
00:08:12|00:08:15|was|NA
00:08:12|00:08:17|show my weaknesses my vulnerabilities|NA
00:08:15|00:08:19|and even to this day it's funny that I|NA
00:08:17|00:08:21|don't see the resumes of my family very|NA
00:08:19|00:08:22|often I think that it's just such a|NA

00:09:27|00:09:31|on the languages and technologies that|NA
00:09:29|00:09:34|you know because then when I meet the|NA

00:09:59|00:10:03|write when you send in the resume you|NA
00:10:01|00:10:04|usually have a chance to introduce|NA
00:10:03|00:10:07|yourself a little bit talk about|NA
