00:02:16|00:02:21|probation you don't have to duck from|A
00:02:17|00:02:24|the camera anymore dude alright do you|A
00:02:21|00:02:27|want to give me a hand with this oh so|A
00:02:24|00:02:30|ha let's go ahead and I'm gonna tip it|A
00:02:27|00:02:33|your way so we're gonna put the stand on|A
00:02:30|00:02:37|with it upside down okay do you want to|A
00:02:33|00:02:40|grab that screwdriver it's okay I got|A
00:02:37|00:02:48|this you can you can trust me he thinks|A
00:02:40|00:02:51|I might drop it gotta say the packing|A
00:02:48|00:02:53|for this is definitely more rudimentary|A
00:02:51|00:02:55|I think this is like a demo unit for|A
00:02:53|00:02:57|sending to potential commercial|A
00:02:55|00:02:58|customers or something|A
00:02:57|00:03:01|there's no I don't even think there was|A
00:02:58|00:03:03|a remote in the box it's a really clean|A
00:03:01|00:03:05|looking TV very little branding got your|A
00:03:03|00:03:09|Sharp logo over here ah quotes and then|A
00:03:05|00:03:14|you've just got eight k76 80 by 40 320|A
00:03:09|00:03:14|pixels baby okay here we go|A
00:03:17|00:03:23|now these HDMI cables are nothing|A
00:03:20|00:03:26|special but theoretically each one of|A
00:03:23|00:03:30|them is only carrying a 4k 60 signal|A
00:03:26|00:03:33|which should be fine just fine except|A
00:03:30|00:03:35|for one small problem no modern graphics|A
00:03:33|00:03:40|card contains more than usually one or|A
00:03:35|00:03:41|two HDMI connections now we tried a|A
00:03:40|00:03:44|solution a little while ago where we|A
00:03:41|00:03:48|used for graphics cards in a Quadro|A
00:03:44|00:03:51|mosaic display thing to drive quadrants|A
00:03:48|00:03:53|of a monitor it didn't work at all it|A
00:03:51|00:03:56|was super stupid performance sucked but|A
00:03:53|00:03:58|fortunately adapters to the rescue so|A
00:03:56|00:04:02|these are active|A
00:03:58|00:04:05|DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 adapters that I|A
00:04:02|00:04:07|acquired for that failed project and I|A
00:04:05|00:04:10|am hoping to finally see some success|A
00:04:07|00:04:18|with today so we're gonna get these bad|A
00:04:10|00:04:21|boys plugged in oh wait oh I had this|A
00:04:18|00:04:24|totally wrong before so when I pointed|A
00:04:21|00:04:27|at the HDMI ports before that was|A
00:04:24|00:04:29|completely wrong the HDMI ports I wanted|A
00:04:27|00:04:33|were down here so these are all just|A
00:04:29|00:04:38|individual normal HDMI ports this is a|A
00:04:33|00:04:40|single input input seven 8k signal input|A
00:04:38|00:04:43|and it's got like cable management clips|A
00:04:40|00:04:46|for and all that shiz so just like that|A
00:04:43|00:04:47|experiment with each separate graphics|A
00:04:46|00:04:51|card running a different quadrant of the|A
00:04:47|00:04:54|display this display does split input|A
00:04:51|00:04:56|seven into quadrants but unlike that one|A
00:04:54|00:04:58|we're using a single graphics card with|A
00:04:56|00:05:01|its single frame buffer in order to|A
00:04:58|00:05:03|drive all four quadrants or rather I|A
00:05:01|00:05:05|should say we're using two in SLI but|A
00:05:03|00:05:07|they're all hooked up to a single one so|A
00:05:05|00:05:09|we don't need any kind of external|A
00:05:07|00:05:12|synchronization card or anything like|A
00:05:09|00:05:15|that it thought should theoretically|A
00:05:12|00:05:19|just work believe it or not this is how|A
00:05:15|00:05:21|they usually run like future panel|A
00:05:19|00:05:24|technology demos at trade shows like CES|A
00:05:21|00:05:26|except instead of actually building them|A
00:05:24|00:05:29|into a real commercialized product they|A
00:05:26|00:05:31|just do it on like a crazy hand soldered|A
00:05:29|00:05:37|thing that sits under the curtain that|A
00:05:31|00:05:39|looks great I'm like feeling the what is|A
00:05:37|00:05:42|it what was it Mac sell or something|A
00:05:39|00:05:46|Memorex but you know that classic|A
00:05:42|00:05:49|commercial but now take KK me no signal|A
00:05:46|00:05:54|from external device hey bottom right|A
00:05:49|00:05:57|grab the signal holy it's on the whole|A
00:05:54|00:06:00|display now hold on a minute|A
00:05:57|00:06:03|no way there's no way it's gonna just|A
00:06:00|00:06:05|run a ke effortlessly okay one of them|A
00:06:03|00:06:08|is running at 50 Hertz why would that be|A
00:06:05|00:06:10|and how would that work that's bizarre|A
00:06:08|00:06:12|why would anyone want that one running|A
00:06:10|00:06:13|at 50 and the others running at 60 okay|A
00:06:12|00:06:16|let's have it|A
00:06:13|00:06:17|let's have a quick boo here so we need|A
00:06:16|00:06:21|to grab some games we're gonna get that|A
00:06:17|00:06:22|going but in the meantime know this did|A
00:06:21|00:06:25|not quite work perfectly out of the box|A
00:06:22|00:06:27|and I do think we have a little bit of|A
00:06:25|00:06:29|configuration to do so let's start by|A
00:06:27|00:06:30|figuring out which one of these is|A
00:06:29|00:06:33|broken|A
00:06:30|00:06:37|I suspect the one that's running at 50|A
00:06:33|00:06:44|Hertz but only one way to find out for|A
00:06:37|00:06:47|oh man that wasn't it oh boy oh boy okay|A
00:06:44|00:06:57|maybe just enter will do it no of course|A
00:06:47|00:06:58|not did it oh boy what is Oh he's dead|A
00:06:57|00:07:01|Jim|A
00:06:58|00:07:04|this isn't even working in the BIOS now|A
00:07:01|00:07:07|this is more broken than it was when we|A
00:07:04|00:07:10|started I have a way of creating hassle|A
00:07:07|00:07:12|where no hassle existed before okay so|A
00:07:10|00:07:16|it's running but still not correctly|A
00:07:12|00:07:18|however before we move forward I've got|A
00:07:16|00:07:21|a bit of an update for you guys as it|A
00:07:18|00:07:24|turns out at least one of the problems|A
00:07:21|00:07:28|we had was caused by invidious seemingly|A
00:07:24|00:07:31|arbitrary limitation on their consumer|A
00:07:28|00:07:33|graphics cards that only allows you to|A
00:07:31|00:07:38|set up an end the surround configuration|A
00:07:33|00:07:44|with a maximum of three displays so this|A
00:07:38|00:07:47|system is out and my test bench is in so|A
00:07:44|00:07:49|we've hooked this up with 2gb 100 Quadro|A
00:07:47|00:07:52|graphics cards these have 32 gigs of ram|A
00:07:49|00:07:55|over 5,000 cuda cores in terms of their|A
00:07:52|00:07:59|gaming performance they shouldn't be|A
00:07:55|00:08:01|that far off something like an RT X 2080|A
00:07:59|00:08:02|I mean they're not quite there but|A
00:08:01|00:08:05|they're certainly closer to that than|A
00:08:02|00:08:06|they are to attend a DTI then we ran|A
00:08:05|00:08:08|into another problem remember how I had|A
00:08:06|00:08:11|three of these DisplayPort to HDMI|A
00:08:08|00:08:14|adapter z' well these cards only have|A
00:08:11|00:08:17|DisplayPort outputs so I had to use|A
00:08:14|00:08:19|DisplayPort to DVI DVI to HDMI and then|A
00:08:17|00:08:23|that to the TV so while we are actually|A
00:08:19|00:08:25|running an Nvidia mosaic configuration|A
00:08:23|00:08:27|here and we can see that if we pull up|A
00:08:25|00:08:30|the Nvidia control panel and|A
00:08:27|00:08:32|theoretically when we go to manage GPU|A
00:08:30|00:08:38|utilization here we're running an SLI|A
00:08:32|00:08:40|but the SLI menu item went away once we|A
00:08:38|00:08:42|configured mosaic and it doesn't appear|A
00:08:40|00:08:45|that our second GPU is actually doing|A
00:08:42|00:08:47|anything for now this is what we're|A
00:08:45|00:08:52|stuck with though and damn it I want to|A
00:08:47|00:08:55|see 8k so we've got another one of these|A
00:08:52|00:08:58|DisplayPort to HDMI adapter and you guys|A
00:08:55|00:09:03|are coming with me for the ride of even|A
00:08:58|00:09:04|if the performance sucks finally getting|A
00:09:03|00:09:09|an 8k output here|A
00:09:04|00:09:11|all right once these are numbered oh I|A
00:09:09|00:09:13|see that's a new one I have literally|A
00:09:11|00:09:16|never seen it do that before|A
00:09:13|00:09:19|okay sure why not remember windows 95|A
00:09:16|00:09:21|guys remember you know who I really feel|A
00:09:19|00:09:24|bad for and all this is sharp they reach|A
00:09:21|00:09:25|out to go yeah you really shouldn't have|A
00:09:24|00:09:28|to jump through a bunch of stupid hoops|A
00:09:25|00:09:30|to get 8k 60 Hertz going on a PC and as|A
00:09:28|00:09:33|far as I can tell none of this is their|A
00:09:30|00:09:35|fault but this is an awful lot of stupid|A
00:09:33|00:09:38|hoops okay so I know set up multiple|A
00:09:35|00:09:39|displays is not the mosaic configuration|A
00:09:38|00:09:42|thing but the reason that I set all this|A
00:09:39|00:09:45|up correctly was that I was hoping that|A
00:09:42|00:09:48|now when we go to set up mosaic it'll|A
00:09:45|00:09:52|kind of grab that everything is the way|A
00:09:48|00:09:53|it's supposed to be and it'll work come|A
00:09:52|00:09:56|on|A
00:09:53|00:10:03|okay well it's letting me click Next and|A
00:09:56|00:10:06|that's correct okay let's try the other|A
00:10:03|00:10:08|graphics card I don't know I did notice|A
00:10:06|00:10:09|that even though we're plugged into the|A
00:10:08|00:10:10|one that would normally be in the|A
00:10:09|00:10:14|primary slot on the motherboard it's|A
00:10:10|00:10:17|identifying as GPU - so who knows maybe|A
00:10:14|00:10:17|this will help|A
00:10:21|00:10:27|there's more lunch frankly I'm pretty|A
00:10:25|00:10:28|close to the end of my rope I was doing|A
00:10:27|00:10:33|some off-screen troubleshooting|A
00:10:28|00:10:37|involving trying older Quadros so GP|A
00:10:33|00:10:40|100's instead of the GV 100's I did a|A
00:10:37|00:10:43|full platform swap and so motherboard|A
00:10:40|00:10:47|CPU change them out just meowed but I|A
00:10:43|00:10:51|don't know and it's always the same|A
00:10:47|00:10:53|thing I click apply it goes little bit|A
00:10:51|00:10:58|little bit yet and then there's no|A
00:10:53|00:11:02|finish but I do not accept that|A
00:10:58|00:11:09|conclusion and I have decided to try one|A
00:11:02|00:11:12|last thing we're gonna go AMD ok so|A
00:11:09|00:11:16|according to this community post it's|A
00:11:12|00:11:16|possible but I think I know why it might|A
00:11:16|00:11:20|not be where|A
00:11:16|00:11:24|okay I think it might just be grabbing|A
00:11:20|00:11:28|my configuration from Windows and then|A
00:11:24|00:11:30|assuming that I want a four by one okay|A
00:11:28|00:11:32|your display configuration has been|A
00:11:30|00:11:39|updated re-enable Eyefinity display|A
00:11:32|00:11:41|group know why the fact that it's rien a|A
00:11:39|00:11:43|below is what's tripping me out here I|A
00:11:41|00:11:45|don't want to re-enable it|A
00:11:43|00:11:47|I want to enable a new different one|A
00:11:45|00:11:49|that is not like what I had before I|A
00:11:47|00:11:51|don't know how to start fresh when I|A
00:11:49|00:11:57|disable it and it only prompts me to|A
00:11:51|00:12:02|re-enable it just AMD things easy|A
00:11:57|00:12:04|Nvidia things oh it's not working to be|A
00:12:02|00:12:07|clear neither of them is giving me a|A
00:12:04|00:12:09|working 60 Hertz a katehis way well|A
00:12:07|00:12:11|other than the boneheaded driver|A
00:12:09|00:12:13|limitation that doesn't allow me to|A
00:12:11|00:12:15|arrange it in a 2x2 this was a much|A
00:12:13|00:12:17|better experience but due to the|A
00:12:15|00:12:19|boneheaded driver implementation that|A
00:12:17|00:12:20|doesn't let me arrange it in a 2x2 I|A
00:12:19|00:12:23|guess we're going back to our next best|A
00:12:20|00:12:26|lead which is Quadro to see if maybe we|A
00:12:23|00:12:28|can get that to work it's been a few|A
00:12:26|00:12:34|more hours and a lifeline has arrived we|A
00:12:28|00:12:38|now have Oh No if they only shipped two|A
00:12:34|00:12:42|I'm gonna be so upset on two|A
00:12:38|00:12:44|no there's four okay the good news|A
00:12:42|00:12:48|though I also reached out to sharp and I|A
00:12:44|00:12:49|was like what tables did you guys use to|A
00:12:48|00:12:52|get this working because they assured me|A
00:12:49|00:12:57|it would be no problem piece of cake|A
00:12:52|00:13:02|piece of crumb cake and they said they|A
00:12:57|00:13:06|got these cables from PC cable world I|A
00:13:02|00:13:09|guess so these are DisplayPort to HDMI|A
00:13:06|00:13:13|cables rather than adapters|A
00:13:09|00:13:15|theoretically that is exactly the same|A
00:13:13|00:13:15|thing|A
00:13:15|00:13:20|at this point I don't know if I know|A
00:13:18|00:13:26|anything anymore if this doesn't work|A
00:13:20|00:13:36|I'm officially stumped here we go one|A
00:13:26|00:13:39|two Wow okay that did grab 4k 60 Hertz|A
00:13:36|00:13:41|on all four of them really fast you have|A
00:13:39|00:13:45|got to be kidding me|A
00:13:41|00:13:45|[Laughter]|A
00:13:50|00:14:03|so after all that I we could do four|A
00:13:58|00:14:06|times 4k but heaven forbid we want to|A
00:14:03|00:14:10|run them in mosaic on Nvidia with|A
00:14:06|00:14:15|adapters on AMD we could do four by one|A
00:14:10|00:14:20|at 4k but heaven forbid we want to|A
00:14:15|00:14:22|rearrange them like this wait what like|A
00:14:20|00:14:25|stop stop don't do it like whatever|A
00:14:22|00:14:26|you're changing now control panel stop|A
00:14:25|00:14:29|changing it because everything is|A
00:14:26|00:14:32|working this is right stop stop changing|A
00:14:29|00:14:35|things finish finish how could I just|A
00:14:32|00:14:37|could I just kill the task I wonder if I|A
00:14:35|00:14:43|can just kill the task Nvidia control|A
00:14:37|00:14:48|panel and task it worked 100% scaling|A
00:14:43|00:14:56|show me that native a K baby Wow|A
00:14:48|00:14:58|60 Hertz a K there it is launching a No|A
00:14:56|00:15:01|so what eight K max draw distance the|A
00:14:58|00:15:03|game wouldn't even launch but we've got|A
00:15:01|00:15:06|it at full medium 8k but there's bad|A
00:15:03|00:15:10|news too it drops to 30 frames per|A
00:15:06|00:15:13|second in the menu when it sits at 60 at|A
00:15:10|00:15:18|the main menu this does not bode well|A
00:15:13|00:15:21|for performance wow this is so like|A
00:15:18|00:15:23|disorienting sitting this close to the|A
00:15:21|00:15:27|city one of the issues with this game's|A
00:15:23|00:15:27|interface in general|A
00:15:27|00:15:32|and we're back so one of the problems|A
00:15:31|00:15:34|that I have with this game in general is|A
00:15:32|00:15:37|that you can't zoom the interface out|A
00:15:34|00:15:39|far enough and I especially feel it like|A
00:15:37|00:15:43|this cuz sitting this close to it|A
00:15:39|00:15:45|honestly is very comfortable in terms of|A
00:15:43|00:15:47|the detail of the game like even at the|A
00:15:45|00:15:50|maxim level let's go ahead and find one|A
00:15:47|00:15:55|of our wood cutters again here this guy|A
00:15:50|00:15:56|walking is cow that is unfreaking|A
00:15:55|00:15:59|believable I don't even have|A
00:15:56|00:16:01|anti-aliasing on I have zero|A
00:15:59|00:16:05|anti-aliasing on right now can you|A
00:16:01|00:16:10|believe that Renan will not look nuts|A
00:16:05|00:16:12|and that's crazy I love it so that was|A
00:16:10|00:16:15|it for a no now we're firing up shadow|A
00:16:12|00:16:18|of the Tomb Raider to see how a like a|A
00:16:15|00:16:21|third-person adventure game feels at 8k|A
00:16:18|00:16:24|so far pretty good I mean it's obviously|A
00:16:21|00:16:27|not running great we're looking at about|A
00:16:24|00:16:29|7 to 20 fps in menu and that's reported|A
00:16:27|00:16:34|by fraps that's clearly not even|A
00:16:29|00:16:39|accurate wow the hair and this is with|A
00:16:34|00:16:42|no anti-aliasing is incredible huh|A
00:16:39|00:16:45|actually in motion it's not nearly as|A
00:16:42|00:16:48|convincing part of that could be the 19|A
00:16:45|00:16:50|frame per second performance though you|A
00:16:48|00:16:52|know say what you will about Nvidia r-tx|A
00:16:50|00:16:55|and the performance impact and all that|A
00:16:52|00:16:58|but you've got our respect Nvidia for|A
00:16:55|00:17:02|recognizing that resolution is no longer|A
00:16:58|00:17:04|the biggest bottleneck in gaming image|A
00:17:02|00:17:06|quality and just trying something|A
00:17:04|00:17:10|anything else because sitting at a|A
00:17:06|00:17:14|reasonable distance like yeah that looks|A
00:17:10|00:17:17|crisp AF but is it really that much|A
00:17:14|00:17:17|better than 4k|A
00:17:18|00:17:24|that does look real sharp though pardon|A
00:17:21|00:17:26|the pun so there you go guys about 15|A
00:17:24|00:17:32|grand worth of graphics horsepower we're|A
00:17:26|00:17:34|looking at 20 FPS average pretty thick|A
00:17:32|00:17:36|let's see how many FPS we get in rocket|A
00:17:34|00:17:40|League hey Riley you want to play rocket|A
00:17:36|00:17:45|League for me help me Riley play at 8k|A
00:17:40|00:17:48|whoa it's an 8k yeah it's a keyboard|A
00:17:45|00:17:50|working hold on there you go there you|A
00:17:48|00:17:52|go whoa|A
00:17:50|00:17:56|like it's one thing being this close to|A
00:17:52|00:17:59|like a huge TV like this but it is like|A
00:17:56|00:18:03|actually sharp oh yeah is it a sharp TV|A
00:17:59|00:18:05|yeah like everything down to the treadle|A
00:18:03|00:18:07|like you can really tell that the the|A
00:18:05|00:18:11|video crowd is just balls|A
00:18:07|00:18:13|yeah it looks so sharp I have never seen|A
00:18:11|00:18:16|this game with this good so could you|A
00:18:13|00:18:18|get into playing on a big screen like|A
00:18:16|00:18:20|this size at this kind of resolution I|A
00:18:18|00:18:22|think I could get into it yeah probably|A
00:18:20|00:18:25|so I guess that's pretty much the|A
00:18:22|00:18:29|conclusion of this video is it K cool|A
00:18:25|00:18:31|yeah really freakin cool it's glitchy|A
00:18:29|00:18:33|right now and we don't have the|A
00:18:31|00:18:37|performance that we need for it to run|A
00:18:33|00:18:39|its best but when it works man is that|A
00:18:37|00:18:42|incredible now I don't think that|A
00:18:39|00:18:44|sitting this close to a TV in order to|A
00:18:42|00:18:47|appreciate the extra sharpness that 8k|A
00:18:44|00:18:49|provides is necessarily practical but|A
00:18:47|00:18:52|that doesn't mean that in applications|A
00:18:49|00:18:53|like VR where the display is much closer|A
00:18:52|00:18:55|to your eyes and you really need that|A
00:18:53|00:18:56|resolution so you don't get a screen|A
00:18:55|00:18:58|door effect that it won't be an|A
00:18:56|00:19:02|incredible difference maker moving|A
00:18:58|00:19:04|forward we just need much more powerful|A
00:19:02|00:19:06|graphics cards and obviously some work|A
00:19:04|00:19:07|on the software side but with the whole|A
00:19:06|00:19:10|you know not wanting to crash all the|A
00:19:07|00:19:11|time and all that speaking of not|A
00:19:10|00:19:13|wanting to crash all the time I'd hate|A
00:19:11|00:19:15|for you guys to get bored and crash out|A
00:19:13|00:19:18|of this video before I tell you about|A
00:19:15|00:19:19|our sponsor the mass drop HD 6xx|A
00:19:18|00:19:22|headphones are one of mass drops|A
00:19:19|00:19:25|all-time bestsellers with over 60,000|A
00:19:22|00:19:27|units sold and no wonder because they've|A
00:19:25|00:19:31|got an unchanged driver structure from|A
00:19:27|00:19:32|the HD 650s which are an absolute legend|A
00:19:31|00:19:35|they've got a detachable six-foot cable|A
00:19:32|00:19:37|instead of a 10-foot cable unlike the HD|A
00:19:35|00:19:39|650 s but the sound signature is|A
00:19:37|00:19:41|unchanged so you've got nice balance|A
00:19:39|00:19:44|mids natural sounding bass and they're|A
00:19:41|00:19:45|open back for a nice natural soundstage|A
00:19:44|00:19:47|they come with Sennheiser's long-term|A
00:19:45|00:19:49|support and you can buy them at the link|A
