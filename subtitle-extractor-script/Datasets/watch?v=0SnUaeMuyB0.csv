00:01:32|00:01:37|<st> Since the early 1970s conspiracy theorists have created ever more elaborate stories about|A
00:01:37|00:01:43|how NASA faked the moon landings, much to the annoyance of the literal hundreds of thousands|NA
00:01:43|00:01:49|of people who worked in some capacity to make these missions a reality, and even more so|NA
00:01:49|00:01:53|to the men who were brave enough to sit in front of a massive controlled explosion, take|NA
00:01:53|00:01:59|a little jaunt through the soul crushing void of space in an extremely complex ship built|NA
00:01:59|00:02:04|by the lowest bidder, then get into another spacecraft whose ascent engine had never been|NA
00:02:04|00:02:10|test fired before they lit the candle, and all with the goal of exiting said ship with|NA
00:02:10|00:02:13|only a special suit between them and oblivion.|NA
00:02:13|00:02:18|And don't even get the astronauts started on the paltry government salary they earned|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|in doing all that and the hilarious lengths they had to go to to provide some semblance|NA
00:02:22|00:02:27|of a life insurance policy for their families should the worst happen during the missions.|NA
00:02:27|00:02:31|So who first got the idea that the moon landings were faked?|NA
00:02:31|00:02:36|While it's highly likely there were at least a few individuals here and there who doubted|NA
00:02:36|00:02:41|man could accomplish such a thing a little over a half century after the end of period|NA
00:02:41|00:02:46|in which humans were still hitching up covered wagons, the first to really get the moon landing|NA
00:02:46|00:02:50|hoax story going popularly was a writer named Bill Kaysing.|NA
00:02:50|00:02:52|How did he do it?|NA
00:02:52|00:02:57|Kaysing self-published a book in 1976 called We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty|NA
00:02:57|00:02:59|Billion Dollar Swindle.|NA
00:02:59|00:03:04|Released a few years after the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, Kaysing’s book popularly introduced|NA
00:03:04|00:03:08|some of the most well known talking points of moon landing deniers, such as that the|NA
00:03:08|00:03:13|astronauts should have been killed when they passed through the Van Allen radiation belts,|NA
00:03:13|00:03:18|noting the lack of stars in photographs, the missing blast crater below the lunar modules,|NA
00:03:18|00:03:19|etc.|NA
00:03:19|00:03:24|"Beyond these, he also had some more, let's say, ""unusual"" and occasionally offensive"|NA
00:03:24|00:03:29|assertions which even the most ardent moon landing denier would probably rather distance|NA
00:03:29|00:03:30|themselves from.|NA
00:03:30|00:03:35|Not exactly a best-seller, Kaysing's book nonetheless laid the ground work for some|NA
00:03:35|00:03:40|of what would come after, with the idea further gaining steam in part thanks to the 1978 film|NA
00:03:40|00:03:46|Capricorn 1, which shows NASA faking a Mars landing and then going to any lengths to keep|NA
00:03:46|00:03:47|it a secret.|NA
00:03:47|00:03:52|As for the film, director Peter Hyams states he first got the idea for such a movie when|NA
00:03:52|00:03:57|"musing over the Apollo 11 mission and thinking, ""There was one event of really enormous importance"|NA
00:03:57|00:03:59|that had almost no witnesses.|NA
00:03:59|00:04:02|"And the only verification we have . . . came from a TV camera."""|NA
00:04:02|00:04:06|Not an accurate statement in the slightest on the latter point, it nonetheless got the|NA
00:04:06|00:04:11|wheels turning and he ultimately developed a script based on this notion.|NA
00:04:11|00:04:15|As to how Kaysing before him came to the conclusion that NASA faked the moon landings, the story,|NA
00:04:15|00:04:20|at least as Kaysing tells it, is that in the late 1950s he managed to view the results|NA
00:04:20|00:04:25|of a highly secretive internal study conducted by NASA on the feasibility of man successfully|NA
00:04:25|00:04:30|landing on the moon that concluded, in his own words: “That the chance of success was|NA
00:04:30|00:04:32|something like .0017 percent.|NA
00:04:32|00:04:36|In other words, it was hopeless.”|NA
00:04:36|00:04:40|Kaysing doesn't explain how NASA came up with such a precise figure given all the unknown|NA
00:04:40|00:04:45|"variables at the time, nor why he put the qualifier ""something like"" followed by such"|NA
00:04:45|00:04:47|an extremely exact number.|NA
00:04:47|00:04:49|He also did not name the report itself.|NA
00:04:49|00:04:54|And, in fact, as far as we can tell, NASA never conducted such an all encompassing study|NA
00:04:54|00:04:58|on the feasibility of a successful moon landing in the 1950s.|NA
00:04:58|00:05:02|Whether they did or not, we did find in our research looking for that report that NASA|NA
00:05:02|00:05:07|conducted a feasibility study on the proposed designs for several manned rockets immediately|NA
00:05:07|00:05:11|prior to Apollo program to decide which contractor to use.|NA
00:05:11|00:05:15|This, of course, has nothing to do with Kaysing, but we figured we’d mention it as we like|NA
00:05:15|00:05:21|to deal in facts and reading Kaysing's various works has us feeling like we need to be cleansed|NA
00:05:21|00:05:25|a little by saying things that are actually true about NASA in this period.|NA
00:05:25|00:05:29|In any event, Kaysing would later assert that he determined from this report that there’s|NA
00:05:29|00:05:36|no way NASA could have improved these 0.0017% odds in the time between the results of this|NA
00:05:36|00:05:40|supposed study and the moon landings about a decade later.|NA
00:05:40|00:05:46|Now, if Kaysing was just some random guy shouting in the wind, it's unlikely anyone would have|NA
00:05:46|00:05:47|listened to him.|NA
00:05:47|00:05:52|Every conspiracy theory origin story needs at least some shred of credibility from the|NA
00:05:52|00:05:55|person starting it to get the fire going.|NA
00:05:55|00:05:59|For Kaysing’s assertions about the moon landings, this comes in the form of the fact|NA
00:05:59|00:06:04|that for a brief period he worked for Rocketdyne, a company that made rockets for the Apollo|NA
00:06:04|00:06:05|program.|NA
00:06:05|00:06:10|Not an engineer or having any similar technical expertise whatsoever, Kaysing's background|NA
00:06:10|00:06:15|was primarily in writing, earning an English degree from the University of Redlands, after|NA
00:06:15|00:06:18|which he naturally got a job making furniture.|NA
00:06:18|00:06:22|As for the writing gig he landed with Rocketdyne, his job was initially as a technical writer|NA
00:06:22|00:06:28|starting in 1956 and he eventually worked his way up to head of technical publications.|NA
00:06:28|00:06:33|He finally quit in 1963, deciding he'd had enough of working for the man.|NA
00:06:33|00:06:38|After quitting, to quote him, “the rat race”, in 1963 Kaysing traveled the country in a|NA
00:06:38|00:06:42|trailer with his family, earning his living writing books on a variety of topics from|NA
00:06:42|00:06:44|motorcycles to farming.|NA
00:06:44|00:06:48|This brings us to 1969 when he, like most everyone else in the world with access to|NA
00:06:48|00:06:50|a TV watched the moon landing.|NA
00:06:50|00:06:54|While watching, Kaysing recalled the supposed NASA study he’d seen all those years ago,|NA
00:06:54|00:06:58|as well as that engineers he'd worked with at the time in the late 1950s claimed that|NA
00:06:58|00:07:03|while the technology existed to get the astronauts to the moon, getting them back was not yet|NA
00:07:03|00:07:04|possible.|NA
00:07:04|00:07:08|He later stated he further thought, “As late as 1967 three astronauts died in|NA
00:07:08|00:07:09|a horrendous fire on the launch pad.|NA
00:07:09|00:07:14|But as of '69, we could suddenly perform manned flight upon manned flight?|NA
00:07:14|00:07:15|With complete success?|NA
00:07:15|00:07:18|It's just against all statistical odds.”|NA
00:07:18|00:07:22|Despite often describing himself as “the fastest pen in the west”, it would take|NA
00:07:22|00:07:27|Kaysing several years to write the book that introduced one of the most enduring conspiracy|NA
00:07:27|00:07:29|theories to the world.|NA
00:07:29|00:07:32|As for why NASA would bother with the charade, he claimed NASA worked in tandem with the|NA
00:07:32|00:07:38|Defence Intelligence Agency to fake the moon landings to one up those pesky Russians.|NA
00:07:38|00:07:42|While certainly good for the country if they could get away with it, the benefit to NASA|NA
00:07:42|00:07:44|itself was, of course, funding.|NA
00:07:44|00:07:49|"Said Kaysing, ""They - both NASA and Rocketdyne - wanted the money to keep pouring in."""|NA
00:07:49|00:07:55|"As to how he knew this, he goes on ""I've worked in aerospace long enough to know that's their"|NA
00:07:55|00:07:56|"goal."""|NA
00:07:56|00:07:57|So how did NASA do it?|NA
00:07:57|00:08:01|He claimed that the footage of the moon landing was actually filmed on a soundstage.|NA
00:08:01|00:08:04|When later asked where this soundstage was located, Kaysing confidently stated that it|NA
00:08:04|00:08:06|was located in Area 51.|NA
00:08:06|00:08:09|As he doesn't seem to have ever given clear evidence as to how he knew this, we can only|NA
00:08:09|00:08:16|assume because it’s not a proper space related conspiracy theory if Area 51 isn't mentioned.|NA
00:08:16|00:08:21|Kaysing also claimed that the F-1 engines used were too unreliable so NASA instead put|NA
00:08:21|00:08:24|several B-1 rockets inside each of the F-1 engines.|NA
00:08:24|00:08:28|Of course, in truth these wouldn't have been powerful enough to get the Saturn V into orbit|NA
00:08:28|00:08:30|even if its tanks were mostly empty.|NA
00:08:30|00:08:35|(And given the frost and ice clearly visible covering certain relevant parts of the Saturn|NA
00:08:35|00:08:39|V here, it's apparent the tanks could not have been mostly empty).|NA
00:08:39|00:08:43|There's also the little problem that the clusters of B-1s he described couldn't have fit in|NA
00:08:43|00:08:48|the F-1 engine bells and you can see footage of the F-1 engines working as advertised,|NA
00:08:48|00:08:51|with no clusters of engines anywhere in sight.|NA
00:08:51|00:08:54|Nevertheless, despite these problems with his story, he did purport that the Saturn|NA
00:08:54|00:08:59|V was launched to space as shown (though at other times has claimed that in fact as soon|NA
00:08:59|00:09:03|as the rocket was out of sight it was simply ditched in the ocean and never made it to|NA
00:09:03|00:09:04|space).|NA
00:09:04|00:09:09|Stick with us here people, he changed his story a lot over the years.|NA
00:09:09|00:09:14|Whatever the case, in all initial cases, he claims the astronauts were not aboard.|NA
00:09:14|00:09:18|(And if you're now wondering how the U.S. fooled the Soviets and other nations tracking|NA
00:09:18|00:09:22|the rockets during these missions, he claims a way to fake signals was devised, allowing|NA
00:09:22|00:09:27|for tracking stations on Earth to think the craft was headed for the moon and, critically,|NA
00:09:27|00:09:31|successfully fooling the Soviets who were indeed closely tracking the missions to the|NA
00:09:31|00:09:33|moon and back.)|NA
00:09:33|00:09:38|So what did Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins do during the mission if they|NA
00:09:38|00:09:41|weren’t zipping around in space?|NA
00:09:41|00:09:45|In the first edition of his book, Kaysing claims that they flew to Las Vegas where they|NA
00:09:45|00:09:50|mostly hung out at strip clubs when they weren't in their rooms on the 24th floor of the Sands|NA
00:09:50|00:09:51|Hotel.|NA
00:09:51|00:09:54|We can't make this stuff up, but apparently Kaysing can.|NA
00:09:54|00:09:58|Kaysing goes on that at one point one of the trio got into a fistfight with someone in|NA
00:09:58|00:10:01|broad daylight over a stripper.|NA
00:10:01|00:10:05|Sadly Kaysing doesn’t reveal which of the men did this, nor how he knew about it, so|NA
00:10:05|00:10:08|we’re forced to assume it was Buzz Aldrin who is the only member of the three we definitely|NA
00:10:08|00:10:11|know actually has gotten in a fist fight.|NA
00:10:11|00:10:16|In this case, in 2002, a 72 year old Buzz Aldrin punched Bart Sibrel who is a “we|NA
00:10:16|00:10:21|never landed on the moon” conspiracy theorist, “documentary” maker, and cab driver.|NA
00:10:21|00:10:25|Sibrel invited Aldrin to a hotel with Sibrel telling him he was making a children’s TV|NA
00:10:25|00:10:26|show on space.|NA
00:10:26|00:10:30|Once Aldrin arrived at the hotel, Sibrel pulled out a Bible and tried to get Aldrin to put|NA
00:10:30|00:10:33|his hand on it and swear that he had walked on the moon.|NA
00:10:33|00:10:35|Needless to say, Aldrin was pretty irritated at this point.|NA
00:10:35|00:10:39|Things got worse when Sibrel called Aldrin a “liar” and a “coward”, at which|NA
00:10:39|00:10:41|point Aldrin punched him.|NA
00:10:41|00:10:47|"As for his defense, Sibrel states, ""When someone has gotten away with a crime, in my opinion,"|NA
00:10:47|00:10:49|they deserve to be ambushed.|NA
00:10:49|00:10:51|"I'm a journalist trying to get at the truth."""|NA
00:10:51|00:10:56|"Unwilling to sway on what that truth is, however, Sibrel states, ""I do know the moon landings"|NA
00:10:56|00:10:57|were faked.|NA
00:10:57|00:10:58|"I'd bet my life on it."""|NA
00:10:58|00:11:02|"Not all is lost, however, because he states, ""I know personally that Trump knows the moon"|NA
00:11:02|00:11:07|landings are fake and he’s biding his time to reveal it at the end of this term, or at|NA
00:11:07|00:11:09|"the end of his second term if he’s re-elected."""|NA
00:11:09|00:11:14|So, rest easy everyone, the truth will come out soon enough apparently.|NA
00:11:14|00:11:17|In any event, going back to Kaysing’s book, he states that shortly before the astronauts|NA
00:11:17|00:11:22|were supposed to begin broadcasting from the moon, all three men arrived on a soundstage|NA
00:11:22|00:11:25|deep within the confines of Area 51 and ate cheese sandwiches.|NA
00:11:25|00:11:31|He also states that along with cheese sandwiches, NASA provided the men with buxom showgirls|NA
00:11:31|00:11:32|while at Area 51.|NA
00:11:32|00:11:37|Presumably this was the only way to pry the astronauts away from the strip clubs.|NA
00:11:37|00:11:42|After eating the no doubt delicious sandwiches, Aldrin and Armstrong put on some space suits|NA
00:11:42|00:11:47|and pretended to walk across a fake moon set while reading out some, to quote Kaysing,|NA
00:11:47|00:11:52|“well-rehearsed lines” in a performance he called “not great” but “good enough”.|NA
00:11:52|00:11:56|A description we personally feel is a little unfair considering it has apparently fooled|NA
00:11:56|00:12:01|seemingly every scientist on Earth then to now, including ones working for the nation|NA
00:12:01|00:12:07|directly competing with the US to land on the moon who would have relished any opportunity|NA
00:12:07|00:12:13|to even allege the whole thing was faked in a credible way, let alone prove it and embarrass|NA
00:12:13|00:12:15|the U.S. utterly in front of the whole world.|NA
00:12:15|00:12:19|But, unfortunately, as you might imagine, the Soviets at the time were monitoring the|NA
00:12:19|00:12:24|whole thing quite closely with their newfangled technology and so never got the opportunity|NA
00:12:24|00:12:26|to disprove the landings.|NA
00:12:26|00:12:30|Amazingly Kaysing also claimed in his book that the fake moon landing footage was filmed|NA
00:12:30|00:12:35|live and that there was only “a seven second delay” between Armstrong and Aldrin’s|NA
00:12:35|00:12:38|performance and the broadcast the world was watching.|NA
00:12:38|00:12:42|Thus, had even a fly buzzed across the set, NASA would have only seconds to notice and|NA
00:12:42|00:12:48|cut the feed, lest such a mistake or inconsistency be noticed in the footage people would be|NA
00:12:48|00:12:50|watching for the rest of human history.|NA
00:12:50|00:12:55|As for the splash down and recovery, he claims the astronauts were eventually put on a military|NA
00:12:55|00:13:00|cargo plane (a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy) and simply dropped from it in the capsule.|NA
00:13:00|00:13:04|As for how he knew this, he did provide a source for once, claiming that an airline|NA
00:13:04|00:13:07|pilot he talked to had seen the Apollo 15 module drop from a cargo plane.|NA
00:13:07|00:13:11|Who this pilot was, what airline he worked for, if he offered any evidence to support|NA
00:13:11|00:13:16|his claim, such as a flight log showing him piloting a plane in the area during the time|NA
00:13:16|00:13:21|of the splash down of Apollo 15, or even when he talked to said pilot, however, he fails|NA
00:13:21|00:13:22|to mention.|NA
00:13:22|00:13:26|As for the moon rocks brought back, these were apparently meteorites found in Antarctica|NA
00:13:26|00:13:29|as well as some that were cleverly made in a NASA geology lab.|NA
00:13:29|00:13:33|As to how NASA was able to keep the lid on things, despite nearly a half a million people|NA
00:13:33|00:13:38|working on the Apollo Program in some capacity, not just for NASA but countless independent|NA
00:13:38|00:13:43|organizations, he claims NASA simply only let those who needed to know the whole thing|NA
00:13:43|00:13:44|was a hoax know.|NA
00:13:44|00:13:48|So following this reasoning that means all these scientists, engineers, etc. working|NA
00:13:48|00:13:53|on all the components and various facets of the mission were genuinely trying to make|NA
00:13:53|00:13:57|the moon landing happen, including knowing the requirements to make it happen and testing|NA
00:13:57|00:14:00|everything they made until it met those requirements...|NA
00:14:00|00:14:04|Meaning what was built and planned should have been capable of doing what the mission|NA
00:14:04|00:14:05|required...|NA
00:14:05|00:14:09|That said, Kaysing admits a handful of people here and there would have had to know the|NA
00:14:09|00:14:15|whole thing was a sham, and thus NASA simply paid off those who could be paid off, promoted|NA
00:14:15|00:14:19|those who preferred that reward, threatened those who still wouldn't go along, and murdered|NA
00:14:19|00:14:23|those who still resisted, which we'll get into shortly.|NA
00:14:23|00:14:28|The ridiculousness of many of these claims and how easily they crumple under the slightest|NA
00:14:28|00:14:34|bit of scrutiny is likely why in the 2002 re-release of his book Kaysing changed his|NA
00:14:34|00:14:39|story in various ways, including claiming that the engines on the Saturn V actually|NA
00:14:39|00:14:44|did work and that Collins, Aldrin and Armstrong did go to space after all, instead of going|NA
00:14:44|00:14:46|to hang out with strippers in Vegas.|NA
00:14:46|00:14:50|He then states that all three men orbited the planet while pre-recorded, not live, footage|NA
00:14:50|00:14:52|was shown on Earth.|NA
00:14:52|00:14:57|Despite, to put it mildly, straining credibility on pretty much everything he said from start|NA
00:14:57|00:15:02|to finish and him providing absurdly specific details, generally without bothering to provide|NA
00:15:02|00:15:06|any evidence whatsoever backing up these claims and changing those specific details frequently|NA
00:15:06|00:15:11|over time, Kaysing’s book and subsequent work nonetheless helped spawn the still thriving|NA
00:15:11|00:15:14|moon landing hoax conspiracy theory.|NA
00:15:14|00:15:16|As for Kaysing, he didn't stop there.|NA
00:15:16|00:15:20|He continued to sporadically come up with new allegations against NASA, including that|NA
00:15:20|00:15:25|the agency murdered the astronauts and teacher aboard the Challenger explosion.|NA
00:15:25|00:15:28|Why would they do this when the whole Christa McAuliffe thing was supposed to be a publicity|NA
00:15:28|00:15:35|stunt to get the public more interested in space travel, science, and what NASA was doing?|NA
00:15:35|00:15:39|According to Kaysing, “Christa McAuliffe, the only civilian and only woman aboard, refused|NA
00:15:39|00:15:42|to go along with the lie that you couldn't see stars in space.|NA
00:15:42|00:15:47|So they blew her up, along with six other people, to keep that lie under wraps...”|NA
00:15:47|00:15:51|Speaking of things that Kaysing said that are ridiculously easy to debunk with even|NA
00:15:51|00:15:54|a modicum of effort, we feel obligated to point out that Christa McAuliffe was not the|NA
00:15:54|00:15:56|only woman on board.|NA
00:15:56|00:16:00|NASA astronaut Judith Resnik was also killed in that tragedy.|NA
00:16:00|00:16:05|Not stopping there, Kaysing also claimed the deaths of the Apollo 1 astronauts were intentional|NA
00:16:05|00:16:09|as one or more of the astronauts aboard was about to blow the whistle on the upcoming|NA
00:16:09|00:16:10|hoax plan.|NA
00:16:10|00:16:14|We feel obligated to point out here that, as previously mentioned, he also used this|NA
00:16:14|00:16:18|fire as evidence of NASA lacking expertise to get a man to the moon...|NA
00:16:18|00:16:23|Meaning according to Kaysing this fire was somehow both intentional to murder a few astronauts|NA
00:16:23|00:16:26|and also accidental owing to NASA's incompetence.|NA
00:16:26|00:16:31|Moving swiftly on, NASA officials also apparently had others killed, including safety inspector|NA
00:16:31|00:16:36|at North American Aviation Thomas Baron who wrote a report on NASA safety protocol violations|NA
00:16:36|00:16:38|after that tragic Apollo 1 fire.|NA
00:16:38|00:16:43|It's at this point, we should probably note that in the 1990s Kaysing decided to sue Jim|NA
00:16:43|00:16:44|Lovell.|NA
00:16:44|00:16:47|"You see, in 1996 Lovell publicly stated ""The guy is wacky."|NA
00:16:47|00:16:49|His position makes me feel angry.|NA
00:16:49|00:16:52|We spent a lot of time getting ready to go to the moon.|NA
00:16:52|00:16:56|We spent a lot of money, we took great risks, and it's something everybody in this country|NA
00:16:56|00:16:57|"should be proud of."""|NA
00:16:57|00:17:02|"Lovell also wrote to Kaysing asking him to ""Tear up your manuscript and pursue a project"|NA
00:17:02|00:17:03|that has some meaning.|NA
00:17:03|00:17:08|"Leave a legacy you can be proud of, not some trash whose readers will doubt your sanity."""|NA
00:17:08|00:17:12|Unwilling to stand for his good name being publicly besmirched, Kaysing naturally sued|NA
00:17:12|00:17:16|Lovell for defamation, though the case was eventually dismissed and nothing ever came|NA
00:17:16|00:17:17|of it.|NA
00:17:17|00:17:20|Kaysing continued to assert that the moon landings were a hoax right up until his death|NA
00:17:20|00:17:27|in 2005, in between writing books on cookery, motorcycle safety, farming, taxes, survival,|NA
00:17:27|00:17:31|how to subsist on very little money, and travel guides, as well as making occasional appearances|NA
00:17:31|00:17:36|on such shows as Oprah expounding on his conspiracy theory work.|NA
00:17:36|00:17:40|On the side he also promoted micro-housing as a solution for homeless people and ran|NA
00:17:40|00:17:44|"a cat sanctuary called ""FLOCK"", standing for ""For the Love of Cats and Kittens""."|NA
00:17:44|00:17:49|So, yes, Kaysing was a man whose passions included micro housing, cats, survival, travel,|NA
00:17:49|00:17:52|living off almost nothing, and rapidly coming up with conspiracy theories.|NA
00:17:52|00:17:57|If only he'd been born later or the interwebs invented sooner, this man could have been|NA
00:17:57|00:17:58|an internet superstar.|NA
00:17:58|00:18:02|Whatever the case, Kaysing’s death understandably garnered a mixed reaction from the scientific|NA
00:18:02|00:18:07|community, with few finding the ability to muster much sympathy for a man who accused|NA
00:18:07|00:18:09|NASA of murdering people.|NA
00:18:09|00:18:13|Gone but not forgotten, Kaysing's ideas have actually gained in popularity in recent years,|NA
00:18:13|00:18:17|particularly among younger generations according to various polls, such as one done by space|NA
00:18:17|00:18:25|consultant Mary Dittmar in 2005 showing that 25% of people 18-25 doubted man had ever walked|NA
00:18:25|00:18:26|on the moon.|NA
00:18:26|00:18:30|This is all despite the fact that it's never been easier to definitively debunk Kaysing's|NA
00:18:30|00:18:31|various assertions.|NA
00:18:31|00:18:37|Not just via reading the countless explanations by scientists definitively addressing point|NA
00:18:37|00:18:43|by point every idea ever put forth by moon landing conspiracy theorists, there's also|NA
00:18:43|00:18:47|the fact that there are literally pictures taken in the last decade showing clear evidence|NA
00:18:47|00:18:53|of some of the equipment sitting on the moon, including for the Apollo 11, 14, 15, 16, and|NA
00:18:53|00:18:55|17 landing sites.|NA
00:18:55|00:19:00|Even in some cases showing the tracks left by the astronauts and the shadows from the|NA

00:19:02|00:19:07|Naturally, moon landing deniers simply claim these photos too were faked, although why|NA
00:19:07|00:19:13|China, India, and Japan should cater to NASA on this one when they independently took pictures|NA

00:19:16|00:19:20|We'll have much, much more on all this in an upcoming article on How Do We Know Man|NA
