00:00:00|00:00:02|<st> |NA
00:00:02|00:00:06| Thanks to Curiosity Stream for supporting PBS Digital Studios.|NA
00:00:06|00:00:09||NA
00:00:09|00:00:14|It looks like I'm wearing really bad tanning oil.|NA
00:00:14|00:00:15|Hey, I'm Dianna.|NA
00:00:15|00:00:16|You're watching Physics Girl.|NA
00:00:16|00:00:19|Just relaxing here in the shade on this beautiful summer day.|NA
00:00:19|00:00:20|Isn't that right, Derek?|NA
00:00:20|00:00:22| Yeah, that's right.|NA
00:00:22|00:00:23| OK, but you're not even in this video yet,|NA
00:00:23|00:00:24|so you just chill.|NA
00:00:24|00:00:27|So a couple of months ago, a few guys got in touch with me|NA
00:00:27|00:00:31|and told me that they had access to a UV camera.|NA
00:00:31|00:00:33|Do you know what that is?|NA
00:00:33|00:00:33| Yes.|NA
00:00:33|00:00:35| Basically, it's a camera that allows|NA
00:00:35|00:00:38|you to see the world in ultraviolet, which|NA
00:00:38|00:00:40|meant a few things for me.|NA
00:00:40|00:00:43|It meant that I could see what this looks like in UV.|NA
00:00:43|00:00:46|I could see what your face looks like without any lotion|NA
00:00:46|00:00:48|or makeup on in UV.|NA
00:00:48|00:00:50|And I could see how sunscreen shows up|NA
00:00:50|00:00:52|on your face in ultraviolet.|NA
00:00:52|00:00:56|And so I said, yes, please do come visit me in San Diego|NA
00:00:56|00:00:58|and bring your UV camera.|NA
00:00:58|00:01:01|And so the guys from the very well-made YouTube channel,|NA
00:01:01|00:01:03|How to Make Everything, showed up at my house.|NA
00:01:03|00:01:05|And this is what we did.|NA
00:01:05|00:01:08| Yeah, on your pants.|NA
00:01:08|00:01:10|Your pants are so tigress right now.|NA
00:01:10|00:01:13| You're going to have some weird tan lines after this.|NA
00:01:13|00:01:15| I was just thinking that.|NA
00:01:15|00:01:16| This is so crazy.|NA
00:01:16|00:01:19| Oh, they're devil horns.|NA
00:01:19|00:01:22| The bigger the better, if you ask me.|NA
00:01:22|00:01:24||NA
00:01:24|00:01:26| I gotta see this.|NA
00:01:26|00:01:27| Is that showing up?|NA
00:01:27|00:01:28| Oh, yeah.|NA
00:01:28|00:01:31| Oh, yeah.|NA
00:01:31|00:01:31| Nice.|NA
00:01:31|00:01:38||NA
00:01:38|00:01:40| Yeah, that was the fun day.|NA
00:01:40|00:01:42|But I should explain why I'm here|NA
00:01:42|00:01:44|with Derek from Veritasium, who is also making|NA
00:01:44|00:01:47|a video about the world in UV.|NA
00:01:47|00:01:49| I've been making this video for like a year.|NA
00:01:49|00:01:51| And I'm here to make him finish it.|NA
00:01:51|00:01:53|But for this video, we're going to cut in a few times|NA
00:01:53|00:01:56|to discuss the sunscreen controversies.|NA
00:01:56|00:01:57| There are a lot of misconceptions|NA
00:01:57|00:01:58|about sunscreens.|NA
00:01:58|00:01:59|And we're going to clear them up.|NA
00:01:59|00:02:00| Yeah.|NA
00:02:00|00:02:01|But for now, I'm going to turn it over|NA
00:02:01|00:02:03|to Dianna in the studio.|NA
00:02:03|00:02:04| Back to you, Diana.|NA
00:02:04|00:02:05| The first thing I wanted to look into|NA
00:02:05|00:02:08|was whether different SPFs, that is,|NA
00:02:08|00:02:10|sun protection factor, which actually|NA
00:02:10|00:02:12|is supposed to indicate how strong the sunscreen is.|NA
00:02:12|00:02:15|But anyways, I wanted to see whether different SPFs|NA
00:02:15|00:02:18|of sunscreen look different under UV light.|NA
00:02:18|00:02:22|And then I wanted to compare whether high SPFs, like SPF|NA
00:02:22|00:02:24|100, are more effective than just|NA
00:02:24|00:02:27|regular high SPFs, like SPF 50.|NA
00:02:27|00:02:28|Here was my thinking.|NA
00:02:28|00:02:31|With a UV camera, things that look lighter|NA
00:02:31|00:02:34|are emitting or reflecting UV light, like the wall behind us.|NA
00:02:34|00:02:36|And things that look darker, like the shirt|NA
00:02:36|00:02:39|that I'm wearing, are absorbing UV light.|NA
00:02:39|00:02:40|Which is something that I think you'd|NA
00:02:40|00:02:43|want to know when it comes to sunscreen, because UV light,|NA
00:02:43|00:02:45|ultraviolet light, of course, is part|NA
00:02:45|00:02:48|of the spectrum of light or electromagnetic waves|NA
00:02:48|00:02:49|from the sun.|NA
00:02:49|00:02:52|And UV is just on the far side of the violet|NA
00:02:52|00:02:54|part of the visible light, rainbow, which|NA
00:02:54|00:02:57|means it's a wave that has a shorter wavelength, which|NA
00:02:57|00:03:01|means it has a higher frequency than any visible light.|NA
00:03:01|00:03:05|And in the end, it can do more damage to molecules like DNA|NA
00:03:05|00:03:06|or to cells.|NA
00:03:06|00:03:09|And as we all know, it's been linked to skin cancer.|NA
00:03:09|00:03:11|So my thinking was that, if you look|NA
00:03:11|00:03:13|at your skin with sunscreen on, you should|NA
00:03:13|00:03:15|see that UV light is absorbed.|NA
00:03:15|00:03:16|So it should look darker.|NA
00:03:16|00:03:18|And yeah, like, when we put the sunscreen on,|NA
00:03:18|00:03:20|it looked like face paint.|NA
00:03:20|00:03:22|We were even able to graffiti the side of the truck|NA
00:03:22|00:03:23|with sunscreen.|NA
00:03:23|00:03:26|But of course, you can only see it with the UV camera.|NA
00:03:26|00:03:29|So my hypothesis was that the sunscreen with the highest SPF|NA
00:03:29|00:03:32|should look darker with the UV camera.|NA
00:03:32|00:03:34|And so we tested a bunch of different sunscreens|NA
00:03:34|00:03:36|with different SPFs on a grid on my arm drawn|NA
00:03:36|00:03:37|with permanent marker.|NA
00:03:37|00:03:38|Here's what we saw.|NA
00:03:38|00:03:40|You can't see anything.|NA
00:03:40|00:03:41| That looks just like a sharpie.|NA
00:03:41|00:03:43| It looks like paint.|NA
00:03:43|00:03:45|Looks like metallic black paint.|NA
00:03:45|00:03:48|Initially, we saw that yeah, the low SPF areas|NA
00:03:48|00:03:50|do look less dark.|NA
00:03:50|00:03:52|You can tell they don't seem to be absorbing|NA
00:03:52|00:03:54|as much ultraviolet light.|NA
00:03:54|00:03:56|But interestingly, there's not a ton of difference|NA
00:03:56|00:03:59|between the 30 to 110 SPFs.|NA
00:03:59|00:04:02|And I've heard this rumor that SPFs above 50,|NA
00:04:02|00:04:04|anything really high, doesn't actually|NA
00:04:04|00:04:07|do anything more than SPF 50.|NA
00:04:07|00:04:09|So I looked into the scientific literature on this.|NA
00:04:09|00:04:10|And I actually found a study that|NA
00:04:10|00:04:13|came out just this year in May 2018 that|NA
00:04:13|00:04:18|tested 199 people with SPF 50 and SPF 100 sunscreens.|NA
00:04:18|00:04:20|Over the course of about six hours of sun exposure,|NA
00:04:20|00:04:24|the subjects got more sunburnt with the SPF 50.|NA
00:04:24|00:04:26|But they do put a nice little disclaimer|NA
00:04:26|00:04:28|at the bottom of the paper that leads you to conclude|NA
00:04:28|00:04:30|that more research needs to be done on whether there|NA
00:04:30|00:04:33|are more benefits over the long term of using|NA
00:04:33|00:04:35|SPF 100 versus 50.|NA
00:04:35|00:04:35|Hey, guys.|NA
00:04:35|00:04:37|I just want to pause on this for a second.|NA
00:04:37|00:04:40|Because I still think it's weird that I had this conception that|NA
00:04:40|00:04:43|above SPF 50, you don't get any more benefits.|NA
00:04:43|00:04:45|And Derek, let me know what you think about this.|NA
00:04:45|00:04:47|But I-- I think I've figured out where|NA
00:04:47|00:04:49|that conception came from.|NA
00:04:49|00:04:53|And I think that it's from a 2011 proposed rule|NA
00:04:53|00:04:56|from the FDA, the American Federal Drug Administration--|NA
00:04:56|00:04:59|they proposed a rule that would limit the maximum allowed|NA
00:04:59|00:05:02|SPF labeling to 50 plus.|NA
00:05:02|00:05:03|Thoughts?|NA
00:05:03|00:05:04| I also don't think it's strange|NA
00:05:04|00:05:07|the conception that the high number sunscreens are all|NA
00:05:07|00:05:09|basically equivalent.|NA
00:05:09|00:05:11|When I lived in Australia, people|NA
00:05:11|00:05:14|were limited to putting only 30 plus on the sunscreen bottles.|NA
00:05:14|00:05:16|And now, they've moved that up to 50 plus.|NA
00:05:16|00:05:19|But it's still, I think, a good idea.|NA
00:05:19|00:05:22|Because as those numbers increase,|NA
00:05:22|00:05:24|you're getting diminishing returns.|NA
00:05:24|00:05:26|So what's the difference between 50 and 100?|NA
00:05:26|00:05:27|Well, it's not really that much.|NA
00:05:27|00:05:29|Because a lot of how effective they|NA
00:05:29|00:05:30|are comes down to how much you apply|NA
00:05:30|00:05:32|and how well you apply it.|NA
00:05:32|00:05:34|So I think it's just a marketing gimmick|NA
00:05:34|00:05:38|to say that this is a 75, or this is an 80, or this is a 90.|NA
00:05:38|00:05:41| So obviously, SPF and the efficacy of different sun|NA
00:05:41|00:05:44|protection factors is still an active area of research.|NA
00:05:44|00:05:47|Anyways, back to the fun day at hand.|NA
00:05:47|00:05:48|When we were looking at the sunscreens|NA
00:05:48|00:05:50|with the different SPFs, we tried a different sunscreen|NA
00:05:50|00:05:54|with SPF 25 and something weird happened.|NA
00:05:54|00:05:56|It was actually lighter.|NA
00:05:56|00:05:58|Like, really light.|NA
00:05:58|00:06:00|This means that it's not absorbing UV light.|NA
00:06:00|00:06:03|But could it still be sunscreening?|NA
00:06:03|00:06:03|Yes.|NA
00:06:03|00:06:06|If it reflects UV light, which is most likely what's|NA
00:06:06|00:06:08|happening here with this sunscreen that|NA
00:06:08|00:06:10|has zinc oxide in it, which is a substance|NA
00:06:10|00:06:14|that's known to reflect some types of UV light.|NA
00:06:14|00:06:18|So, this is where I got really confused.|NA
00:06:18|00:06:20|I started looking up some sunscreen ingredients|NA
00:06:20|00:06:22|and what they do and why some are reflective|NA
00:06:22|00:06:24|and others are absorptive.|NA
00:06:24|00:06:25|And I ended up going down the rabbit hole|NA
00:06:25|00:06:27|of sunscreen controversies.|NA
00:06:27|00:06:29|I'll get to the discussion on health|NA
00:06:29|00:06:31|effects of different sunscreen ingredients in a minute.|NA
00:06:31|00:06:34|But I did find that Hawaii recently banned some sunscreens|NA
00:06:34|00:06:35|from the state.|NA
00:06:35|00:06:37|The reason why is that ingredients|NA
00:06:37|00:06:41|oxybenzone and octinoxate were found to be contributing|NA
00:06:41|00:06:43|to coral reef bleaching, a process whereby|NA
00:06:43|00:06:47|coral polyps expel the little algae living inside of them--|NA
00:06:47|00:06:49|actually sounds like an exorcism,|NA
00:06:49|00:06:51|but it is, in fact, a bad thing.|NA
00:06:51|00:06:55|So starting in 2021, Hawaii is banning any sunscreens|NA
00:06:55|00:06:56|with those ingredients.|NA
00:06:56|00:06:59|This ban was based off of recent research.|NA
00:06:59|00:07:01|Which begs the question, are the health effects|NA
00:07:01|00:07:03|and environmental effects of sunscreen ingredients|NA
00:07:03|00:07:04|not well known?|NA
00:07:04|00:07:06|OK, I'm just going to pause here again.|NA
00:07:06|00:07:08|Because I feel like this is a good discussion for us.|NA
00:07:08|00:07:09|There is a lot to unpack here.|NA
00:07:09|00:07:13|But I want to start out with that SPF 25 sunscreen that|NA
00:07:13|00:07:14|was really reflective.|NA
00:07:14|00:07:17| There's two major ways that sunscreens can protect|NA
00:07:17|00:07:19|your skin from UV light.|NA
00:07:19|00:07:22|One of the ways is by absorbing that light|NA
00:07:22|00:07:25|and turning that energy into heat.|NA
00:07:25|00:07:27|And another way is by reflecting the light.|NA
00:07:27|00:07:30|And what you saw was clearly more reflection.|NA
00:07:30|00:07:32|Now, in the media, they're often called|NA
00:07:32|00:07:35|physical versus chemical sunscreens, which is maybe|NA
00:07:35|00:07:37|not the best designation.|NA
00:07:37|00:07:38| I don't think it's the best.|NA
00:07:38|00:07:40| Because they are all chemicals.|NA
00:07:40|00:07:42|Maybe it's a better distinction to say that the chemical|NA
00:07:42|00:07:46|sunscreens are organic, because they are organic molecules.|NA
00:07:46|00:07:47|They have these chains of carbon.|NA
00:07:47|00:07:50|And the so-called physical sunscreens|NA
00:07:50|00:07:52|are inorganic molecules, things like titanium dioxide|NA
00:07:52|00:07:53|and zinc oxide.|NA
00:07:53|00:07:55|So they do a bit more reflection.|NA
00:07:55|00:07:56|But they also do scatter the light.|NA
00:07:56|00:07:57|They absorb the light.|NA
00:07:57|00:07:59| This chemical versus physical distinction|NA
00:07:59|00:08:01|bothers me, as you know.|NA
00:08:01|00:08:04|Because I think it's used in a misleading way|NA
00:08:04|00:08:07|on a lot of health blogs and in a lot of media|NA
00:08:07|00:08:09|indicating you should avoid these chemical|NA
00:08:09|00:08:11|sunscreens because they're chemicals.|NA
00:08:11|00:08:12| You don't like it.|NA
00:08:12|00:08:13| I don't like it.|NA
00:08:13|00:08:14| Because they're all chemicals.|NA
00:08:14|00:08:14| Right.|NA
00:08:14|00:08:15| Everything's a chemical.|NA
00:08:15|00:08:16| Right.|NA
00:08:16|00:08:19| I think there is a deeper reason why people would|NA
00:08:19|00:08:22|say chemical versus physical, because chemical could|NA
00:08:22|00:08:24|describe, by virtue of its chemistry, that's how|NA
00:08:24|00:08:25|it interacts with the light.|NA
00:08:25|00:08:29|Whereas, a physical sunscreen, by virtue of its structure,|NA
00:08:29|00:08:31|is really how it interacts with the light.|NA
00:08:31|00:08:33|You're right when it comes to the marketing,|NA
00:08:33|00:08:34|people do try to use the chemical label|NA
00:08:34|00:08:36|as a negative term.|NA
00:08:36|00:08:39| And I think that it actually hides an important discussion|NA
00:08:39|00:08:42|about the potential safety issues of what|NA
00:08:42|00:08:43|they call chemical sunscreens.|NA
00:08:43|00:08:46|So we're discovering things about sunscreen ingredients|NA
00:08:46|00:08:46|all the time.|NA
00:08:46|00:08:48|For example, recent research has shown|NA
00:08:48|00:08:50|that some sunscreen ingredients--|NA
00:08:50|00:08:52|and in particular, some of the organic sunscreen ingredients--|NA
00:08:52|00:08:55|can get into the bloodstream and into breast milk|NA
00:08:55|00:08:59|through your skin, which led the FDA to recently state that this|NA
00:08:59|00:09:02|is a significant discovery that needs to be considered as we|NA
00:09:02|00:09:04|continue to evaluate the health and safety of sunscreen|NA
00:09:04|00:09:05|ingredients.|NA
00:09:05|00:09:07|In fact, the FDA just recently rejected|NA
00:09:07|00:09:09|eight new proposed sunscreen ingredients.|NA
00:09:09|00:09:11| Because they felt there wasn't enough|NA
00:09:11|00:09:14|science to show that these ingredients were safe.|NA
00:09:14|00:09:17| But my question is that, now that we know|NA
00:09:17|00:09:19|sunscreen ingredients can enter the body through the skin,|NA
00:09:19|00:09:23|should we be looking back at those 16 ingredients?|NA
00:09:23|00:09:25|Should we be looking at them through the lens|NA
00:09:25|00:09:29|of the new research and judging them with the same thoroughness|NA
00:09:29|00:09:32|that we're judging these eight new ingredients against,|NA
00:09:32|00:09:33|for example?|NA
00:09:33|00:09:36| What's surprising to me is that there is still so much|NA
00:09:36|00:09:39|to be learned about sunscreen.|NA
00:09:39|00:09:43|I think it's a little weird because on the one hand,|NA
00:09:43|00:09:46|you're saying these health blogs are saying chemicals bad.|NA
00:09:46|00:09:48|But on the other, you're saying, well,|NA
00:09:48|00:09:51|maybe chemicals are bad, because they haven't been really|NA
00:09:51|00:09:51|tested yet.|NA
00:09:51|00:09:54| That's not why people are saying that they're bad.|NA
00:09:54|00:09:56|And in fact, some of them may be perfectly fine,|NA
00:09:56|00:09:58|and they get lumped in with the ones that do have,|NA
00:09:58|00:10:00|that do cause skin allergies.|NA
00:10:00|00:10:04|Like, to say because they're chemicals is the reason,|NA
00:10:04|00:10:07|you might lose out on potentially a ton|NA
00:10:07|00:10:09|of great sunscreen ingredients that|NA
00:10:09|00:10:12|are going to be really effective for protecting|NA
00:10:12|00:10:13|the populace against skin cancer.|NA
00:10:13|00:10:17|But people have lumped them into this chemical category,|NA
00:10:17|00:10:19|which really just means organic molecule category.|NA
00:10:19|00:10:21|Maybe we're going to find ones that|NA
00:10:21|00:10:24|don't get absorbed into the bloodstream as readily.|NA
00:10:24|00:10:24|You know what I mean?|NA
00:10:24|00:10:25| Yeah.|NA
00:10:25|00:10:28| There is so much to be learned.|NA
00:10:28|00:10:30| But at the end of the day, I think, put on the sunscreen.|NA
00:10:30|00:10:32| At the end of the day, do you want skin cancer?|NA
00:10:32|00:10:35| Because it is the most common cancer in the US.|NA
00:10:35|00:10:36| You heard it from the man.|NA
00:10:36|00:10:37|Wear sunscreen, kids.|NA
00:10:37|00:10:39|Oh, yeah, also thank you for watching this video.|NA
00:10:39|00:10:42|And check out Derek's video, which is going to be about--|NA
00:10:42|00:10:44| The world in UV.|NA
00:10:44|00:10:47|Something about sunscreen, but about everything else, too.|NA
00:10:47|00:10:49| Really cool experiments that we filmed yesterday.|NA
00:10:49|00:10:51|Check out the video by the How to Make Everything guys.|NA
00:10:51|00:10:54|They made sunscreen in the end.|NA
00:10:54|00:10:55| Did they?|NA
00:10:55|00:10:55| Yeah.|NA
00:10:55|00:10:56| Awesome.|NA
00:10:56|00:10:56| Yeah.|NA
00:10:56|00:10:57| I'll watch that.|NA
00:10:57|00:10:59| I will link both of those videos in the description|NA
00:10:59|00:11:01|and at the end of this video or whatever.|NA
00:11:01|00:11:04|Thanks so much for watching, and happy physics-ing.|NA
